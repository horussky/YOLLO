<p>With over <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">300+ million members worldwide</a>, Facebook is the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/facebook.com#">2nd most trafficked site</a> in the world, sitting only behind Google. With stats like these, it&#8217;s no wonder businesses are turning to Facebook for further exposure.</p>
<p>With the right set up, you can effectively use Facebeook to gain more brand exposure, traffic and sales and in this article I&#8217;ll guide you through how I personally use Facebook to do this, along with some other alternatives.<span id="more-4728"></span></p>
<h3>Set Up Your Profile</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s start at the basics, you&#8217;re going to need a Facebook profile (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/justcreative">see mine here</a>). I&#8217;ve personally got two profiles, one for business and one for private life. The choice here is yours but you must realise that your followers are going to see photos from you on the weekend, along with other personal details. For this reason, I keep both private and business lives separate, though I do make my business profile a bit personal too.</p>
<p>You could also split your one profile into two by utilising Facebook&#8217;s lists and privacy settings. How to do this is explained in the article <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/08/14/facebook-networking/">How to use facebook for professional networking</a>.</p>
<p>After setting your profile up, ensure you <a href="http://www.facebook.com/username/">get a vanity URL</a> which is a personalised address. ie. <a href="http://facebook.com/justcreative">http://facebook.com/justcreative</a></p>
<p>To read more about the <a href="http://www.sugarrae.com/the-updated-unofficial-and-smartass-guide-to-using-facebook/">basics of Facebook</a> you can read this guide and also this great article on <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/04/02/facebook-personal-brand/">how to build your personal brand on Facebook</a>.</p>
<h3>Fill Out Your Profile + Add Links</h3>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/profile-1.jpg" alt="Profile" width="500" height="466" /></p>
<p>This may sound like common sense but not everyone does it. Fill out all of the fields that Facebook provides, taking special note of the sections that get the most visibility (as highlighted in the picture above). You can see on the left side of my profile I&#8217;ve linked to my three websites, along with my other social networking profiles (<a href="http://twitter.com/justcreative">Twitter</a> &amp; <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/justcreativedesign">LinkedIn</a>).</p>
<p>As for your own profile picture, ensure that it is the same picture you use on the rest of your profiles. As you can see the picture I use for Facebook is the same I use for my website and other social accounts. This is for brand consistency.</p>
<p>You could also <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/2009/02/facebook-profile-photo-hacks/">get creative with your Facebook profile</a> picture. Also, be sure to check out this article on <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/04/01/optimize-facebook-page/">how to optimise your facebook presense.</a></p>
<h3>Set Up A Fan Page</h3>
<p>After you have set up your profile you will want to set up a &#8220;fan page&#8221; (<a href="http://facebook.com/justcreativedesign">see mine here</a>) for your business. A fanpage is essentially the way your client base can keep in touch with your business - basically a Facebook version of your online presence. As quoted in <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/09/22/facebook-pages-guide/">Mashable&#8217;s Facebook Fan Page Guide</a>, a fan page provides a place to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview of your company</li>
<li>Website and contact info</li>
<li>Press releases</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Blog RSS</li>
<li>Twitter updates</li>
<li>Company news and status</li>
<li>Customer interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>To <a href="http://www.facebook.com/advertising/?pages">set up your fan page</a>, log in to Facebook, scroll to the bottom and click on <em>Advertising</em>. Then click <em>Pages</em> and <em>Create a Page</em>. Select the type of business you own and start filling in all the details. The more info you add, the better your page will be and remember, Google thinks highly of Facebook in its search engine results. Ensure you <a href="http://www.facebook.com/username/">set up a vanity url for your fan page</a>.</p>
<p>For some examples of great branded Facebook pages, have a look at these <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/06/16/killer-facebook-fan-pages/">5 inspiring case studies</a> and this article on the <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/03/30/successful-facebook-fan-page/">elements of successful Facebook Fan Pages</a>.</p>
<p>Below you can see an example of how users have interacted with a blog post that was posted to my Fan Page.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/note-1.jpg" alt="note" width="500" height="356" /></p>
<h3>Set Up A Group</h3>
<p>You may be wondering, why do you need both a fan page and a group? In short, they both engage with users in different ways. The group allows users to interact on a more personal level where as the fan page is more focused on your business &amp; brand. For further clarification, read this article on <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/05/27/facebook-page-vs-group/">what&#8217;s the difference between Facebook Pages &amp; Facebook Groups</a>?</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/create.php">set up a Facebook Group</a> here. As an example you can see the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=9707402676">Just Creative Design</a> group here - notice how users have added photos of their work, linked to their profiles and other news? This allows your brand to give something back to your community, while also giving your brand more exposure.</p>
<h3>Automise Your Twitter &amp; Facebook Promotion</h3>
<p>After you have set up your profile, fan page and group, you will want to automise as much of your marketing as possible to save time and hassle. The good news is that nearly everything can be automated - the only work you have to do is monitor &amp; reply to the comments / media left on the pages. Below I&#8217;ve gone through how to automise your Twitter &amp; Facebook marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Feed your blog to Twitter &amp; Facebook:</strong> Whenever I write a new blog article, I&#8217;ve set it up so an automatic tweet goes out to all my Twitter &amp; Facebook followers. I&#8217;ve done this via the use of the <a href="http://twitterfeed.com">Twitter Feed</a> service though there are <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/05/25/twitter-to-facebook/">many other options</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Send your tweets to Facebook:</strong> This may not suit everyone however the way I use Twitter is basically to share quality links with others, which in turn brings more followers, thus maximising the visiblity and exposure of my brand.</p>
<p>Whenever I send a tweet, I&#8217;ve got it set up (<a href="http://www.ajvaynerchuk.com/how-to-link-twitter-to-facebook-a-twitter-tutorial/">short tutorial for set up here</a>) for all my tweets to go to Facebook as well. This allows interaction on both platforms. For example, see a recent tweet that went to Facebook below.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/newlogo.jpg" alt="New Logo" width="500" height="539" /></p>
<p>There is also a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=115463795461">Selective Twitter Status Facebook App</a> that allows you to choose which Tweets get sent to Facebook which is great for those heavy chatters.</p>
<p>Something else worth mentioning is the tool called <a href="http://tweetlater.com/">TweetLater</a> which allows you to pre schedule Twitter posts in advance. Very handy for promotion while your away. For more Twitter tips, visit this <a href="http://www.caroline-middlebrook.com/blog/twitter-guide/">Ultimate Twitter Guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Promote Your Facebook Pages</h3>
<p>In short, getting traffic and exposure from Facebook is relative to how you use it, how you promote your profiles and how you go about integrating Facebook with your other marketing efforts. Send out occasional promotions but don&#8217;t go overboard &amp; remember that what works for one person or business, may not work for another.</p>
<p>As a general guide for promotion, do to others as you would like done to you because what goes around, comes around.</p>
<p>I also recommend reading this article: <a href="http://www.allfacebook.com/2009/07/facebook-small-business/">9 rules of facebook promotion for small business</a>.</p>
<h3>More ways to promote using Facebook</h3>
<p>There are many other ways to implement Facebook into your online marketing. Although I have not yet ventured into these areas, they are worth knowing about.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/advertising/">Paid Facebook Advertising</a></li>

</ul>
<p>For even more Facebook resources see this massive list of <a href="http://www.insidecrm.com/features/facebook-marketing-toolbox-012308/">100 Facebook tools and tips</a>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As Mashable states in many of their <a href="http://mashable.com/category/facebook/">Facebook related articles</a>, your Facebook promotional efforts will be ongoing, so plan to dedicate a few hours each week to updating content and getting new followers. You’ll quickly appreciate the instant ability to connect with your fans, customers and future customers through this valuable social media tool!</p>
<p>Think of your Facebook profile as a digital asset and grow the equity in that asset over the rest of your brand&#8217;s life. Also be sure to <a href="http://mashable.com/2008/12/24/free-brand-monitoring-tools/">monitor your brand&#8217;s reputation</a>.</p>

<p>After two strong years of blogging, I&#8217;ve decided to take two months off to go traveling. I will be monitoring my three sites while I am gone but there will be very limited posts throughout this time.</p>
<p>I am off for a road trip across <a href="http://contiki.com.au/tours/12-grand-southern">22 states of USA</a> for 6 weeks then back to Australia for a 2 week family holiday / Christmas. I then fly back to New York to <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/07/24/aussie-goes-nyc/">start full time </a><a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/07/24/aussie-goes-nyc/">work</a> at <a href="http://carrotcreative.com">Carrot Creative</a> of which, I hope to continue to blog on a fortnightly basis. I also plan to keep running <a href="http://logooftheday.com">Logo Of The Day</a> and to a lesser extent, <a href="http://logodesignerblog.com">Logo Designer Blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Birthday, Graduation &amp; Moving Out<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be turning 22 years old during my time away, graduating from University, moving out of home (and country) and making the <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/resources/helpful-tips-for-switching-to-the-mac-os/">switch from PC to Mac</a>, so it&#8217;s all happening! This blog also just had it&#8217;s 2nd birthday last week, which admittedly, I forgot about.</p>
<p><strong>Judging Roles</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also just been selected to be a part of the judging panel for the 2010 Annual Design Awards along side <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carson_(graphic_designer)">David Carson</a>, Matthew Walker (ESPN Art Director) and more. More info on that next year. I&#8217;ve also been chosen to be on the judging panel for the 2nd year running for the <a title="Project Never" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.projectnever.com/');" href="http://www.projectnever.com/">Project Never</a> competition, a competition that judges the &#8220;best rejected designs&#8221;. I am also judging &#8220;the best websites of the world&#8221; over on <a href="http://thecssawards.com/">The CSS Awards</a> and continue to judge logos for my other site, <a href="http://logooftheday.com">Logo Of The Day</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Arts Articles</strong></p>
<p>Keep an eye out for Issue 171 of Computer Arts magazine as I&#8217;ve written two typography related articles that will be appearing in there.</p>
<p><strong>Free Logo Copyright Poster</strong></p>
<p>In my <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/11/11/freelance-graphic-designer/">recently completed work</a> post, I mentioned I was going to release a free A3 PDF of my Logo Copyright Poster&#8230; you can now <a href="http://logodesignerblog.com/free-logo-copyright-poster/">preview &amp; download it here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Interview</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also had the pleasure of being interviewed for the website <a href="http://yourhiddenpotential.co.uk/">Your Hidden Potential</a>, a website that showcases entrepreneurs under 27 years of age. <a href="http://yourhiddenpotential.co.uk/2009/11/09/yhp-interviews-jacob-cass/">You can read the interview here</a>. On the topic of interviews, I recently <a href="http://liveandbreathe.wordpress.com/2007/12/04/stefan-sagmeister/">read one with Stefan Sagmeister</a> and I highly recommend having a look.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Festive Season!</strong></p>

Here a small showcase of my most recent freelance design work along with a brief description of each.<span id="more-4787"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Sikh Youth Australia Website Design<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>This is my largest and most recent website to date. It has been built from scratch and is currently in coding, using Expression Engine as the CMS. It will feature a rotating article slide show, an article accordion (similar to the left side bar of this site) and a nice drop down CSS Menu along with loads of other user interactivity. The right side bar &amp; footer will be on every page of the site.</p>
<p><strong>Update 12/11/09: Testimonial</strong></p>
<p>Just received a very nice <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/testimonials/">testimonial</a> from Saranpaal Calais, the Sikh Youth Australia Project Coordinator:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We took on Jacob as designer for a new website for Sikh Youth Australia, a national community youth organisation. This project was a large undertaking and involved the organisation of a lot of functionality and content, whilst keeping the website design clean, fresh and modern.</p>
<p>Right from the get go, Jacob impressed us with his commitment to the project and insightful research and analysis of our requirements. His design process demonstrated a high level of professionalism, flair and sophistication. At the same time he was also able to communicate effectively and work very closely with the project team, responding constructively in interpreting and working with our feedback.</p>
<p>The end product was a website that exceeded our expectations in regards to creating a fantastic brand image / feel, whilst also maximising functionality. His attention to detail and understanding of current design trends and practices allowed us to achieve a result that we are extremely proud of and we would recommend Jacob without hesitation to anyone who wants a striking, professional, and functional website.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3>Oké Rum Liqueur Bottle &amp; Identity Design</h3>
<p>This was a full branding job for a Jamaican rum liqueur  / cocktail that has been in development for several months now. Work included the  identity design, bottle design and a 3D render mockup (done in Cinema 4D). The bottle is soon to be manufactured.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/okerum.jpg" alt="Oke Rum" width="500" height="700" /></p>
<p>Below, you can see a screen shot of me modeling the the Oké bottle in Cinema 4D. You could also <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/04/13/design-process-for-my-vodka-premix-bottle/">read about the design process</a> of a similar project I did for a Vodka bottle design.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4816" title="Bottle Design" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/bottle-design-making-of.jpg" alt="Bottle Design" width="500" height="305" /></p>
<h3>Scott Barnes Digipack Album Cover</h3>
<p>This is an album cover for <a href="http://www.scott-barnes.com">Scott Barnes</a>, an musician from just outside Washington DC. The album art plays on the themes of fire and revolution. It is to be printed in January after his EP has been mastered.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/scottbarnes.jpg" alt="Scott Barnes" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<h3>Logo Copyright Poster</h3>
<p>This is a personal project that I have been working on. The poster features the (reversed) logos of the top <a href="http://logodesignerblog.com/100-best-global-brands-of-2009/">100 top global brands</a> of 2009 as ranked by Interbrand, formed into the shape of the copyright symbol. The bottom right text says: &#8220;Good artists copy, great artists steal&#8221; ~ Pablo Picasso.</p>
<p>The idea behind the poster was to question the blurring lines between art, design and copyright. Can one just take a whole series of others work, put it into a new shape and call it art? Or is it design? I think Picasso&#8217;s quote also draws on similar thoughts&#8230; what&#8217;s the difference between <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/02/20/graphic-design-plagiarism-rip-offs/">copying and stealing</a>? <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/03/30/the-secret-to-creativity/">What is the secret to creativity</a>?</p>
<p>Anyway, you can interpret as you wish. You can <a href="http://logodesignerblog.com/free-logo-copyright-poster/">download this as a free A3 PDF Poster here</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4805" title="copyright" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/copyright.jpg" alt="copyright" width="330" height="446" /></p>
<h3>Keep Calm and Stay Safe Letterpress Poster</h3>
<p>This poster was part of a campaign that was running at Newcastle University raising awareness of student safety. I utilised the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterpress_printing">letterpress</a> to create a poster inspired by a British motivational poster from 1939, titled &#8220;Keep Calm and Carry On&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the bottom left photo, you can see how I have cut away at lino for hours on end to create the letter forms. Blood, sweat and tears went into this one&#8230; well maybe not tears, but certainly blood.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/letterpress.jpg" alt="Letterpress" width="500" height="332" /></p>
<h3>Learnworks Logo &amp; Identity Design</h3>
<p>This is the rest of the identity design for the Learnworks logo that I posted about a <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/10/09/logo-designer-australia/">few weeks ago</a>. Learnworks provides on-site training, books and e-learning courses. I also had the fun job of designing their Word and Powerpoint templates.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/learnworksstationery.jpg" alt="Learnworks Stationery" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<h3>MEGS Logo Design</h3>
<p>MEGS is a program being developed by the NSW Department of Education and Training, TAFE and the University of Newcastle. It aims to bring students to Universities across the State. MEGS stands for &#8220;Making Educational Goals Sustainable&#8221;. The concept behind this piece was to show the cross roads of life and also to show the concept of bringing students into University&#8230; plus X does mark the spot.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/megslogo.jpg" alt="MEGS Logo" width="500" height="335" /></p>
<h3>Love Christ, Love Life Advertising Campaign</h3>
<p>This was a recent piece of work completed for University for an advertising campaign promoting the life of Jesus. The use of the heart and Christ symbols create a powerful message.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image-376.jpg" alt="Love Life" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<h3>Beolchi Rangel Identity Design</h3>
<p>The identity design for Beolchi Rangel, a business management consulting business based in Brazil. I wrote up a process of <a href="http://logodesignerblog.com/creating-a-logotype/">how I made this logotype</a> over on Logo Designer Blog.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/beolchirangelletterhead.jpg" alt="Beolchi Rangel Letterhead" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<h3>Morning Fog Album</h3>
<p>This was an experimental piece for a fictional client. I was experimenting with mark making, ink, paper and sponges and I really liked how some of the marks came out, so I decided to make it into a music album.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/morningfog.jpg" alt="Morning Fog" width="500" height="499" /></p>
<h3>Medium Experimentation</h3>
<p>This was another experimentation with many different mediums - chalk, crayon, pencil, oil pastel, biro, soft pastel, charcoal and digital manipulation. Thought it came out pretty cool, could see it on a club flyer or album cover.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/experimentation.jpg" alt="Experimentation" width="375" height="500" /></p>
<h3>Dr. Reg Edward Logo Design</h3>
<p>Dr. Reg Edward is a British doctor who uses innovative targeted regional anesthetic techniques to target pain rather than putting patients on highly potent drugs. The concept is based on targeting the pain, hence the crosshair, however there is also a hidden + symbol inside the negative space.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/drreg.jpg" alt="Dr. Reg" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<h3>Opus Grex Identity Design</h3>
<p>This is the logo design for a new website that is soon to launch. All I can say is that the site will be a place for people to go to &#8220;collaborate on problem solving&#8221;. Opus Grex is latin for &#8220;the work of the crowd&#8221;.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/image-377.jpg" alt="Opus Grex" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<h3>Alexandre Mantacheff Identity Design</h3>
<p>This is the logo design for a high end art &amp; antique gallery established in New York who is operating under it’s Parisian endorser’s name of Alexandre Mantacheff. The shape you see in the middle is actually an oil tower from back in the 1880&#8217;s, as per the client&#8217;s request. Love the &#8216;ff&#8217; ligature on the end.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/alexandremantacheff.jpg" alt="Alexandre Mantacheff" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<h3>Ford Logo Redesign</h3>
<p>This was a personal project, my take on redesigning the current Ford logo. I kept elements from the original logo, however made it much more modern.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/fordlogo.jpg" alt="Ford Logo" width="500" height="332" /></p>
<h3>Biotechnology Logo Design</h3>
<p>This is the new identity design for the Undergraduate Biotechnology Program at The University of Newcastle.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/biotech.jpg" alt="Biotech" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<h3>Business Organiser Identity Design</h3>
<p>This is a logo design for a business coach / consultant that organises other people&#8217;s businesses via the use of better systems, layouts &amp; management. A minimalist, near zen-like approach was taken here with emphasis on O for organisation. The rest of their identity is still in the works.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/businessorganiser.jpg" alt="Business Organiser" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<p>Comments, constructive criticism and questions are welcome, as always.</p>

Twitter just recently introduced <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/how-to-get-started-with-twitter-lists/">Twitter lists</a>, a helpful way to better organise the tweets of those you follow. Twitter lists also allow you to find interesting groups of people to keep track of via the use of others recommendations.</p>
<p>After much research looking into other Twitterer&#8217;s lists and via the use of <a href="http://listorious.com/">Listorious</a>, I&#8217;ve compiled these ten <a href="http://listorious.com/tags/design">design twitter lists</a> that are definitely worth following.</p>

<p>I recently wrote an article for <a href="http://freelancefolder.com">Freelance Folder</a> about <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/email-subscription-box-tutorial/">how to get more subscribers by adding an email subscription box</a> and within the comments, <a href="http://www.troypeterson.com/2009/10/improve-rss-and-email-followers/">Troy Peterson</a> left a great tip on how to optimise the copywriting to maximize subscription signups and I thought it was worth sharing&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>One thing that will improve your signups as well, is to replace “Subscribe” with “Get Updates”.</p>
<p>Many people tend to associate “Subscribe” with some type of commitment. This is typically carried over from the old days of Magazine subscriptions, where people had to commit for a year and pay a price.</p>
<p>Even with the name “free” on it, people are still hesitant.</p>
<p>I recommend trying “Get Updates by Email” or “Get Updates by RSS”.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s always good practice to do a before and after testing to find the best results… but, it’s well worth the small effort to make the changes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Below you can see how I have worded my new subscription box, along with a few other minor adjustments.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/subscribe.jpg" alt="Subscribe" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Update 6/11/09:</strong> I&#8217;ve slightly updated the copy to what is seen above.</p></blockquote>
<p>Could it do better? What&#8217;s your opinion?</p>

<p>Logo design is arguably one of the hardest parts of graphic design though with a little insider knowledge, you may find it&#8217;s not so difficult after all. By understanding what makes a &#8220;good&#8221; logo and the principles behind effective logo design you will be on the right track in no time. In this tutorial you will be guided through the logo design process, from initial brief right through to delivery while being given vital logo design tips along the way.</p>
<p>For the sake of this tutorial we will be creating a fictional logo - for now I&#8217;ve gone with a logo that reflects the first and last letters of my name - J &amp; C. Through the use of negative space and a few nifty Illustrator tricks we will combine these characters (J &amp; C) to create an iconic logo design. At the end of the tutorial, you may find that your own initials can be used too.</p>

<h3><strong>Logo design tutorial:</strong></h3>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/principlesofeffectivelogodesign.jpg" alt="Principles of Effective Logo Design" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Before we head straight into <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/01/08/how-to-design-a-logo/">creating the logo</a> you must understand what a logo is, what it represents and what it is supposed to do. A logo is not just a mark - a logo reflects a business’s commercial brand via the use of shape, fonts, colour, and / or images. A logo is for inspiring trust, recognition and admiration for a company or product and it is our job as designers to create a logo that will do its job.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/applelogo.jpg" alt="Apple Logo" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> But <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/07/27/what-makes-a-good-logo/">what makes a good logo</a>? A good logo is distinctive, appropriate, practical, graphic, simple in form and conveys an intended message. There are five principles that you should follow to ensure that this is so… In no particular order, an effective logo is simple, memorable, timeless, versatile and appropriate. An example of a logo that achieves all these things is the Apple logo.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/jclogo.jpg" alt="J&amp;C Logo" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Now that we know the basic principles behind logo design, we should begin the logo design process. In the real world we would be given a brief, have to do research, brainstorming, etc. though for the sake of this tutorial we are creating a fictional logo design based on my initials, J &amp; C. For now, open the jc.eps file that you can <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/web/jc.eps">download here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/jc.jpg" alt="J &amp; C" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> In this EPS, you will find the completed logo and also the outlined version of the J&amp;C. I&#8217;ve used the typeface Helvetica Neue 83 Extended with 82pt type so if you have this typeface you will not need the EPS file. You will be needing the Pathfinder tool panel too, so go ahead and open this up. Go to Window &gt; Pathfinder. I also find working in the Typography Workspace is the best for logo design. Go to Window &gt; Workspace &gt; Typography to set this up.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/createoutlines.jpg" alt="Create Outlines" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> If you are using the font directly (not from the EPS), you will need to outline your text as this will turn your text into movable objects. To do this, right click on the text and click &#8216;Create Outlines&#8217;. After you have done this, you are up to where the CD users start off. Now you will have to ungroup your characters - to do this, select the text, right click, click &#8216;Ungroup&#8217;.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/releasepaths.jpg" alt="Release Paths" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Now we are going to turn the ampersand into 3 objects rather than just one. To do this we must release the original path of the ampersand. To do this, select the ampersand, right click and then choose &#8220;Release Compound Path&#8221;. You will notice the two counters of the ampersand go black - this shows that it is now in 3 pieces.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/turntowhite.jpg" alt="Turn To White" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> From here we are going to turn the ampersand into negative space, ie. using the white space to create an object. To do this, select the ampersand and turn it to the colour white using the swatch panel. Take note not to turn the two inside counters white. Now select the two counters and the ampersand, right click and press &#8220;Group&#8221;.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/positionampersand.jpg" alt="Position Ampersand" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Now that we have the logo all set up, it is time to position the ampersand. Using the select tool, select the ampersand. Position the ampersand over the J and it should look something like above. Align the left side of the ampersand with the left vertical side of the J, ensure that the J is not broken into two parts.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sendtoback.jpg" alt="Send To Back" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> From here, using the select tool, select the C, right click on it, go to Arrange &gt; Send To Back. This moves the letter C behind the other two letters and is necessary for the next step.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/positionc.jpg" alt="Position C" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Select the letter &#8216;C&#8217; with the move tool and position it underneath the white ampersand. I&#8217;ve positioned the &#8216;C&#8217; just where it meets the middle of the ampersand as outlined with the red arrow above. Zoom in to 6400% and ensure that it is exactly in line, not just close, but exact. Precision is required in logo design.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/dragnode.jpg" alt="Drag Node" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> You will notice that the ampersand doesn&#8217;t cover all of the C and leaves an unsightly jagged edge at the bottom, as pointed to by the red arrow. To get rid of this you will have to select the Direct Selection tool, click once on the ampersand and then once one the bottom right node. Zoom in as much as you can and drag out the node in a diagonal straight line.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/notcompletedyet.jpg" alt="Not Completed Yet" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> You may think that this is the completed logo design though it is not. Although it looks exactly like the finished logo, the ampersand is still white which means when placed on another background other than white, the ampersand shows as white, as shown in the example screenshot above.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pasteinfront.jpg" alt="Paste In Front" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>13.</strong> To counter this what we have to do is use the pathfinder tool to cut out the ampersand from the other letters. We need to make three ampersands to be able to do this. Select the ampersand and go to Edit &gt; Copy and then Edit &gt; Paste In Front. Repeat this twice. You will not be able to tell but there are now three ampersands there.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pathfinder.jpg" alt="Pathfinder" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>14.</strong> Grab the selection tool, select the top ampersand and then while holding shift, click the &#8216;J&#8217;. From here we want to use the Pathfinder window to cut it away. While they are selected choose the Minus Front option from the pathfinder palette. At this stage it looks like it has not done anything but it has.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/patherfinder2.jpg" alt="Patherfinder 2" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> You will have to repeat the same steps as above but for the letter &#8216;C&#8217;. Select the ampersand, and while holding shift, click the letter &#8216;C&#8217;. Choose the &#8220;Minus Front&#8221; selection from the Pathfinder palette to cut away the ampersand from the &#8216;C&#8217;. It will still look nothing has changed but it has.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ungroup.jpg" alt="Ungroup" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> There is now one ampersand left. Click on this using the selection tool, right click and click ungroup. This will allow you to select the three parts of the ampersand. Click on the large part of the ampersand and press delete. The shape of the logo is now complete. Highlight the four parts of the logo, right click and click group. This will ensure the logo stays as is.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/variations.jpg" alt="Variations" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> After the logo shape has been completed, you will want to fine tune it and experiment with colours and typefaces. I&#8217;ve shown some variations for you just to give you an idea of what you could do, though experimentation &amp; comparison is the key here.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/jclogo-1.jpg" alt="J&amp;C Logo" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p><strong>18.</strong> After you have finalised the logo design, you would essentially deliver it to the client in a variety of formats including eps, pdf, tiff, jpg, gif and if you&#8217;re feeling nice, you may want to include a FavIcon too. Now that you are done, try to see if you can do it for your own initials too.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://twitter.com/Vonster/">Von</a> <a href="http://logodesignerblog.com/logo-design-tips-von-glitschka/">Glitschka</a>&#8217;s simply awesome <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/vonster/gifts?st=date_created&amp;ps=60">Zazzle store</a>, where I just recently bought his <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/tickles_the_evil_clown_tshirt-235930128955488548">Tickles &#8220;Evil Clown&#8221; t-shirt</a>, I thought I&#8217;d see how opening a store of my own would go. You never know, right?</p>
<p>Though before I did that, I thought I should wait to check out the quality of Zazzle&#8217;s products and overall service. I didn&#8217;t have to wait long - just 5 days after ordering I received my shirt (and I&#8217;m down in Oz). I was also pleasantly surprised at the high quality of their products, especially considering their very competitive pricing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve compiled a few products for you below, though the best thing about Zazzle is that you can customise the product to anything you want - ie. you keep the same graphic and then you can change its sizing, spacing, alignment or even change the product itself to a women&#8217;s hoody or mouse pad, among hundreds of other products.</p>
<p>If you want to take a look at my store, <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*">click here</a> or click on any of the shirt photos below. All the shirts are on sale from a small $12.95.</p>
<h3>Sultan Of Sultans</h3>
<p>&#8216;Sultan of Sultans&#8217; means King of Kings and is a mixture of elements relating to this theme. Lion (King of the Jungle), Crown (Symbol of Leadership) and Space (King Of The Universe).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sultanofsultans.jpg" alt="Sultan Of Sultans" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<h3>Excelisor Bot</h3>
<p>This little robot is created entirely out of the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/excelsior/">Excelsior</a> typeface. I recently wrote a tutorial for Layers Magazine on <a title="Illustrator Tutorial" href="http://www.layersmagazine.com/using-the-glyphs-panel-in-illustrator.html">how to create your own font monster</a> if you&#8217;re interested. There is an angled version (1st pic below) or a straight version (2nd pic below). Remember you can change the t-shirt colour to anything you like! You can also change the sizing, alignment, etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/excelsiorbot.jpg" alt="Excelsior Bot" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/excelsiorbot1.jpg" alt="Excelsiorbot" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<h3>Just Creative Design Logo</h3>
<p>This one I am really curious about but I thought I&#8217;d chuck it in anyway. Judging by <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/09/21/funny-odd-emails-recieved/">some of the emails</a> (one marriage proposal so far), you just never know.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/justcreativedesign.jpg" alt="Just Creative Design" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<h3>Love Christ, Love Life</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4687" title="Love Life" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/love-life.jpg" alt="Love Life" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p>Although I am not a Christian, this was a recent piece of work I completed for University for an advertising campaign promoting the life of Jesus (as above). After  I shared it on <a href="http://twitter.com/justcreative">Twitter</a> I had a couple of requests to actually make it into shirts, so I thought why not. Here are a few combinations below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/lovelife.jpg" alt="Love Life" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/lovechrist.jpg" alt="Love Christ" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<p>The below version features a small logo on the back, as well as a larger version of the &#8220;Love Life&#8221; text on the front.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/lovechristback.jpg" alt="Love Christ Back" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<h3>Comic Sans?</h3>
<p>This little character, like the Excelsior Bot, is created entirely out of Comic Sans. The idea is that he is saying &#8220;What!? Comic Sans?&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/comicsansshirt.jpg" alt="Comic Sans Shirt" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<p>Below is a version without the text.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/comicsans-1.jpg" alt="Comic Sans" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<h3>Lightning Bolt</h3>
<p>This is a minimalist retro t-shirt design of an electric lightning bolt coming down from the skies above.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/lightningbolt.jpg" alt="Lightning Bolt" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<h3>Love Life</h3>
<p>Similar to the other <em>Love Life</em> shirts, but without the cross.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/justcreative*"><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/image-375.jpg" alt="Image" width="402" height="402" /></a></p>
<h3>My Zazzle Flash Store</h3>
<p>You can scroll through the products using the Flash application below.</p>
<p><object width="450" height="300" data="http://www.zazzle.com/utl/getpanel?tl=My%20Zazzle%20Panel&amp;at=238221093124216972&amp;cn=238221093124216972&amp;st=date_created" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="flashvars" value="feedId=0&amp;path=http://www.zazzle.com/assets/swf/zp/skins" /><param name="src" value="http://www.zazzle.com/utl/getpanel?tl=My%20Zazzle%20Panel&amp;at=238221093124216972&amp;cn=238221093124216972&amp;st=date_created" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /></object></p>
<p>If you find anything else in my <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/portfolio">portfolio</a> you would like made into a product or if you have any requests at all, just let me know and I will put something together for you. Anyway, interested to see how this goes.</p>
<p>If you have your own store, tips or suggestions, please share in the comments below. Thanks!</p>

<p>With such a plethora of choice it may be hard to find the right designer for your specific needs. Below is a short guide to help you make the right choice when choosing a logo designer. These points could also be useful when hiring a web designer, graphic designer, or any designer for that matter.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want this post to come across as self promotional, however, I&#8217;ve linked to my own examples to show you how I personally communicate to potential clients the value of my design work. For other designers, I hope this in turn, gives you an idea of how you too can communicate the value of your work.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<p><span id="more-4514"></span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Success &amp; Experience</strong></h3>
<p>Do they have a proven <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/about/">successful track record</a>? How experienced are they? Previous identity projects will give you a good idea of what skill level your designer is at and what you can expect though this is not to say that a new designer can not produce top quality results - this point has to be considered with all of the other points mentioned below, in which case a strong portfolio is probably the best indicator.</p>
<p>For examples of some quality identity design, please check out <a title="Logo of the day" href="http://logooftheday.com">Logo Of The Day</a>, where <a href="http://logooftheday.com/meet-the-judges/">Jeff Fisher and I</a> feature a new talented logo designer every day.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Positive Testimonials</strong></h3>
<p>Have they got positive <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/hire-me/testimonials">testimonials</a> from past clients and colleagues?</p>
<p>Ensure you check the testimonials validity which can be done by looking for a web address or even by emailing the company. It&#8217;s a good idea to check if the company even exists.  <strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>3. A Thorough Design Process</strong></h3>
<p>Do they have a <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/02/01/logo-design-process-of-top-graphic-designers/">logo design process</a> in which they follow or are they simply <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/05/24/do-you-want-fries-with-that-logo/">producing logos like fast food</a>? A typical process does not take under 48 hours to complete which is why I wrote the article <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/01/how-not-to-design-a-logo/">How NOT To Design A Logo</a> which tells you to avoid design contests, logo factories, etc.</p>
<p>Think for how long your logo design will be in use - would you want that to be designed (let alone researched) in under 48 hours? Logo design is not a take away food store and this is <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/05/22/why-logo-design-does-not-cost-5-dollars/">why logo design does not cost $5.00</a>.</p>
<p>There is no &#8216;typical&#8217; time frame as every client will have different needs but for small and medium businesses a rough guide would be around 2 - 6 weeks.  <strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>4. Awards Won / Published Work</strong></h3>
<p>Have they won any <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/10/01/jacob-cass-wins-logo-design-awards/">awards</a> for their work? Is their work <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/08/17/logo-lounge-volume-5-book-review/">published in any books</a> or <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/01/10/my-cover-article-in-layers-magazine-negative-space/">magazines</a>? How recognised are they in the industry?  <strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>5. A Strong Portfolio</strong></h3>
<p>How strong is their <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/portfolio/">portfolio</a>?  What is the make up of real to &#8216;<a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/06/01/fake-logo-designs-revisited/">fake&#8217; logo designs</a>? When I say &#8216;fake logos&#8217; I refer to the logos made for fictional companies, rather than for real clients.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/inkdrops.jpg" alt="Ink Drops" width="500" height="250" /> <strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>6. Price</strong></h3>
<p>The costs of the service is usually quite evident of what you are going to receive. In most cases, you will get what you pay for but don&#8217;t take price as the only indication.</p>
<p>How much does a logo design actually cost? In my experience, this is the most frequently asked question and the hardest to answer. This is because every company has different needs&#8230; the best approach is to draw up a customised quote for each individual client.  <strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>7. Design Affiliations</strong></h3>
<p>Are they affiliated with any design associations or publications? This is a good indication of how dedicated they are to their craft though is not at all essential.</p>
<p>As an example, I am a member of <a href="http://www.photoshopuser.com/members/">NAPP</a> - The National Association of Photoshop Professionals and <a href="http://logolounge.com">Logo Lounge</a>, an online gallery for logo design professionals. Other affiliations could be <a href="http://www.aiga.org/">AIGA</a>, <a href="http://www.howdesign.com/GeneralMenu/">HOW</a> or even a local design group.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Great Customer Service</strong></h3>
<p>Do they respond to your emails quickly? How do they communicate &amp; present themselves? A designer should provide great customer service throughout the whole process, from the initial email right through to after sales support.  <strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>9. Business Professionalism</strong></h3>
<p>Attention to detail, trustworthiness, strong communication skills and time management are all vital and go hand in hand with great customer service.  <strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>10. Appropriate Questions</strong></h3>
<p>A designer should ask a variety of questions to find out your needs in relation to your business goals. Questions should revolve around the companies history, target market, competitors, company goals, etc. For an example of the questions asked, <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/hire-me/">check out my logo design questionnaire</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>In summary<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>These are 10 things you should take into account when choosing a logo designer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proven Success &amp; Experience</li>
<li>Positive Testimonials</li>
<li>A Thorough Design Process</li>
<li>Awards &amp; Published Work</li>
<li>A Strong Portfolio</li>
<li>Price</li>
<li>Design Affiliations</li>
<li>Great Customer Service</li>
<li>Business Professionalism</li>
<li>Appropriate Questions</li>
</ol>

<p><em>As part of this year&#8217;s</em> <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/09/24/blog-action-day/"><em>Blog Action Day</em></a><em> focusing on climate change, I have Simon Owens from</em> <a href="http://www.care.org/"><em>CARE</em></a> <em>come to talk to you about the effects of climate change and what you can do to help. I&#8217;ll pass you onto Simon now&#8230;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.care.org/climate">Climate change</a> is not only about melting ice caps and polar bears. <strong>Climate change is about people</strong>.</p>
<p>Swinging weather patterns are creating disasters on a scale that human civilization has never before witnessed. For the world’s poorest people – the ones least equipped to deal with its effects – climate change is devastating their crops, livelihoods and communities.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Climate change is worsening the plight of those hundreds of millions of men, women and children who already live in extreme poverty – and it threatens to push hundreds of millions more people into similar destitution,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>says CARE International’s Secretary General Robert Glasser.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A concerted international response to this unprecedented challenge is required if we are to avoid catastrophic human suffering.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>CARE is working toward a world where poor people can create opportunity out of crises like climate change. But the current reality is that climate change makes poor people even more vulnerable.</p>
<p>For instance, agricultural production will likely decline in the poorest countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Less reliable rainfall will likely affect planting seasons, crop growth and livestock health – and lead to increased malnutrition. In other parts of the developing world, flooding will likely further diminish the quality of already-marginal soil and could cause outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as cholera and dysentery.</p>
<p>Climate change also is hurling many poor families into “Catch-22” situations. For example, they may select crops that are less sensitive to rainfall variation, but also less profitable. As incomes decline and people are not able to eke out a living, children are forced to leave school, assets are sold off to afford essentials, malnutrition rates increase and large-scale migration ensues. The end result? Deepening poverty for tens of millions of people around the world.</p>
<h3>What Must Be Done?</h3>
<p>At the international level, negotiations to develop a new treaty to guide global efforts to address climate change will take place in Copenhagen, Denmark in just a couple weeks. The United States must help lead those efforts, and forge a strong agreement that caps emissions, stops global warming and responds to the effects already in motion. We must do this for the sake of all of humanity.</p>
<h3>What can you do to help?</h3>
<p>First, you can make a <a href="http://www.care.org/donate/index.asp?s_subsrc=blogs">tax-deductible donation</a> to CARE to help poor families access the tools and education they need to adapt to the effects of climate change, make efficient use of their existing resources and overcome poverty for good.</p>
<p>Second, if you live in the Unites States, you can <a href="https://my.care.org/site/Advocacy?s_src=170941770000&amp;s_subsrc=blogs&amp;s_src=ClimateChangeURL&amp;cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=383">write your senators</a> and urge them to pass the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, a critical step toward U.S. leadership in tackling climate change. U.S. leadership is critical to making the Copenhagen negotiations a success.</p>
<p>Third, you can join the <a href="http://www.care.org/climate">CARE mailing list</a> to be kept up to date on CARE’s activities and other ways you can take action in the days counting down to Copenhagen.</p>

<p>One a similar note, I&#8217;ve just recently reached another milestone - I&#8217;ve now had a <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/hire-me/clients/">client </a>from every continent of the globe, except Antarctica. This is something I never would have dreamed of 2 years ago when I started this blog and I find it amazing how small the Internet makes the world. Thank you for all your support and if you know a penguin, please do let me know.<span id="more-4489"></span></p>

Avenir LT Std 95 Black Oblique, 35 Light Oblique, 35 Light are the typefaces used. Melissa also kindly wrote a rather large testimonial for her time working with me - below is a snippet.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jacob is a pleasure to work with. He is courteous, patient with questions, reliable, and a great communicator. He is very focused on the creative process and he completed my project well before the deadline. And not only did Jacob deliver logos that I could emotionally connect to and identify with, he went out of his way to kindly advise me on how best to integrate one of the logos with my website.</p>
<p>Anyone who takes that extra care to help you succeed is someone worth sticking with! Jacob truly cares about his clients, and even though the project is finished, I still feel supported by him in continuing to build my business! …” <a href="http://linkedin.com/to/justcreative">Read full testimonial here</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Rehab Massage Website</strong> - This was a website I completed for Dennis Jablonski, a remedial therapist based in Queensland, Australia. The website is still currently being coded and the content added. The logo was designed elsewhere (not a huge fan).</p>
<p>Here is what Dennis said about his time working with me:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Jacob absolutely nailed my website in his first draft, delivering a perfect result much faster than I expected!</p>
<p>When I contacted Jacob about designing my website I was highly unorganised, lacking vision, ideas and actual content - possibly a ‘designer’s nightmare’!</p>
<p>Jacob’s excellent communication skills and wealth of experience in dealing with small business clients meant he could quickly identify my needs and business image and provide much needed guidance with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>I consider myself very lucky to have met Jacob and highly recommend him!“</p></blockquote>

<p>Does being a starving artist suck? Even if you are not starving, you should get yourself familiar with the books &amp; resources of <a href="http://twitter.com/jeremytuber">Jeremy Tuber</a>, a designer &amp; author based in Arizona, USA.</p>
<p>Jeremy and myself have been in contact via email &amp; twitter in a very on and off fashion, though over the conversations we have had, I&#8217;ve found Jeremy&#8217;s pragmatic &amp; practical knowledge in business to be quite profound and this is clearly shown throughout his books &amp; resources.</p>
<p>About four months ago, Jeremy kindly sent me two of his books (<a href="http://beingastarvingartistsucks.typepad.com/basas/jacobcass.html">Verbal Kung Fu For Freelancers</a> and <a href="http://beingastarvingartistsucks.typepad.com/basas/jacobcass.html">Being A Starving Graphic Artist Sucks</a>) and over these last four months have found them very handy - below are two short reviews of these two books.</p>
<h3>Verbal Kung Fu For Freelancers</h3>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/verbalkungfuforfreelancers.jpg" alt="Verbal KungFu For Freelancers" width="500" height="134" /></p>
<p>Although I am not overly fussed by the design of the book itself, the information inside is invaluable and I have referred to it many a time. This book tells you <strong>how to talk and deal with your clients needs</strong>, but done in a very to the point way. It&#8217;s basically a &#8216;questions and answers&#8217; book.</p>
<p>For example, pretend you have a client asking you to lower the price of your original quote. How would you respond? If you refer to the pricing section of the Verbal Kung Fu book, it would tell you <em>exactly</em> what to write and in some cases, it gives you two options to choose from.</p>
<p><a href="http://beingastarvingartistsucks.typepad.com/basas/jacobcass.html">Verbal Kung Fu For Freelancers</a> is essentially about &#8220;how to talk to clients&#8221; and if you&#8217;re like me and the vast majority of your communication is done via email, you have all the time in the world to refer to this book to find out how to appropriately &amp; effectively deal with your clients needs, without jeopardising your income or dignity.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t come across a book like this before and I highly recommend it. Its 166 pages are well categorised for easy referencing and is a &#8216;keep in your top draw&#8217; kind of book. You also read what Steve from LogoFactory <a href="http://www.thelogofactory.com/logo_blog/index.php/practical-how-to-business-advice-for-the-freelance-designer/">had to say about Jeremy&#8217;s books.</a></p>
<h3>Being A Starving Graphic Artist Sucks</h3>

<p><a href="http://beingastarvingartistsucks.typepad.com/basas/jacobcass.html">Being A Starving Graphic Artist Sucks</a> (500 pages) is the second book I received and is much larger than the Verbal Kung Fu book. It&#8217;s a &#8220;complete resource&#8221; on how to be a successful freelancer.</p>
<p>It deals with such things as how to find clients &amp; how to run your design business including thorough expert advice in areas that designers struggle in: pricing, marketing, negotiations, customer service and sales.</p>
<p>Although I didn&#8217;t read this book from front to back (I&#8217;ve already read <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/03/24/graphic-design-books/">similar books</a>) it is clear that Jeremy knows how to run a design business and is certainly a book worth checking out. It really is a &#8220;complete resource&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Discounts &amp; Freebies</h3>
<p>Readers of this blog can get <strong>25% off</strong> any of Jeremy&#8217;s digital products OR get a <strong>free ebook</strong> when you purchase a printed book from Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="http://beingastarvingartistsucks.typepad.com/basas/jacobcass.html">You can click through to view all products &amp; discounts.</a></p>

<p>Throughout June and July I was on vacation travelling through <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/japan?openMap=true">Japan</a>, Cambodia, Vietnam and New Zealand and as usual, with any major trip, I share the photos and stories with you.</p>
<p>I posted the <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/07/25/kingdom-of-cambodia/">Cambodia</a> &amp; <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/08/20/vietnam-holiday-photos/">Vietnam</a> photos a few weeks back and now I’ve finally had the chance to go through the Japan &amp; New Zealand photos.</p>
<p>The Japan leg of my Asian themed holiday was spent with my mother and was a gift for my 21st birthday. It was great to spend some quality time with her while experiencing the Japanese culture and it also gave me a chance to do things that I wouldn&#8217;t have done if I was traveling with my mates.</p>
<p>In Japan we went to Tokyo, Shinagawa, Yokohama, Shizuoka, Nagoya, Kyoto, Hikone, Miyajima, Okayama, Hiroshima and Takayama. Click the map for a larger view of where we travelled.</p>

<p>We went on a one day tour on the first day (which was a great choice) and the tour leader was great&#8230; this is her carrying her infamous Pikachu.</p>

<p>A play we saw in Japanese. It was a comedy and you could understand what was happening without knowing the language. It was based on two people being tied up because they drink too much&#8230; but then find a way to drink by helping each other.</p>

<p>Having tea at a Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony">Tea Ceremony</a>. This lady has been doing it for 20 years!</p>
<blockquote><p>The Japanese tea ceremony or &#8220;the Way of Tea,&#8221; is the ceremonial preparation and presentation of the powdered green tea known as matcha. The tea ceremony is highly ritualized and the manner in which it is performed. Zen Buddhism was integral to the ceremony&#8217;s development, and its influence pervades many aspects of its performance.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Future Travel Plans</h3>
<p>My original travel plan for November / December was to travel through South America however I have since decided to travel through USA instead. The reasoning for this was because of the very competitive airfares, great AUD to USD exchange rate and I thought I should get more acquainted with the <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/07/24/aussie-goes-nyc/">USA before moving to work there</a>.</p>
<p>As for the trip, I am going on another <a href="http://contiki.com.au/tours/12-grand-southern">Contiki tour</a> - this time across 22 states of USA starting from Los Angeles going East, right through to New York, where I will meet my employers, <a href="http://carrotcreative.com">Carrot Creative</a>, for the first time.</p>
<p>I will leave mid November, travel around for 6 weeks, return to Australia for 2 weeks for a family holiday, then fly back to New York again in early January where I will have to settle down and get back to the real (working) world.</p>

This is breaking news in Australia - we&#8217;ve released a new &#8216;creamier&#8217; version of our much loved Vegemite (a vegetable yeast spread similar to Marmite). No joke it was on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald website.

<p>This is <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/executive-style/and-the-winner-is-x2026-a-happy-little-vegemite-20090926-g73s.html">breaking news</a> in Australia - we&#8217;ve released a new &#8216;creamier&#8217; version of our much loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegemite">Vegemite</a> (a vegetable yeast spread similar to Marmite). No joke it was on the front page of the <a href="http://smh.com.au/">Sydney Morning Herald</a> website.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kraft Foods yesterday announced the winning name: <a href="http://www.vegemite.com.au/vegemite/page?siteid=vegemite-prd&amp;locale=auen1&amp;PagecRef=758">Vegemite iSnack 2.0</a>.</p>
<p>West Australian web designer Dean Robbins, 27, beat more than 48,000 entrants to come up with the winning name. Other entries suggested were Ruddymite, Wow Chow and 2ritemite.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all a bit tongue-in-cheek, really. The &#8216;i&#8217; phenomenon and web 2.0 have been recent revolutions and I thought the new Vegemite name could do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simon Talbot from Kraft Foods said: &#8220;The name Vegemite iSnack2.0 was chosen based on its personal call to action, relevance to snacking and clear identification of a new and different Vegemite to the original. We believe these three components completely encapsulate the new brand.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When I first saw it I was like &#8220;Oh no, this has got to be a joke&#8221; but nope, it&#8217;s the real deal. A half smart marketing ploy but I wonder how long this name will last?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Update 29th September:</strong></p>
<p>There may be a <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/is-vegemites-isnack-toast-20090928-g8gk.html">legal battle on for the name &#8216;iSnack&#8217;</a> but not with who you may think.</p>
<p><strong>Update 30th September:</strong></p>
<p>Kraft is <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/business/isnack20-fury-prompts-naming-rethink-20090930-gbwt.html">considering axeing</a> the name of  iSnack2.0. (Thanks to <a href="http://interlinks.com.au/">Cameron</a> for the tip.)</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again - October 15th is <a href="http://blogactionday.com/">Blog Action Day</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Blog Action Day is an annual event that unites the world&#8217;s bloggers in posting about the same issue on the same day on their own blogs with the aim of sparking discussion around an issue of global importance. Blog Action Day 2009 will be the largest-ever social change event on the web. One day. One issue. Thousands of voices.</p></blockquote>
<p>This year the topic is <a href="http://www.climatechange.gov.au/science/publications/fs-climatechange.html">Climate Change</a> (of which I voted for back in August) and am glad it was picked as this years topic of choice as Climate Change is effecting us all (and our children) whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to bat on like some Greenpeace activist but Blog Action Day is for a good cause and you should consider getting involved - at least <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CnIJ19EVMo&amp;feature=player_embedded">check out the video</a> below.</p>
<p><object width="500" height="304" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/3CnIJ19EVMo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3CnIJ19EVMo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>Only last year <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/11/07/11000-dollar-prize-giveaway-design-group-writing-project-for-charity/">did this blog raise USD$1620 in funds</a> for the <a href="http://www.change.org/blogactionday/projects/fundraising/just_creative_designs_poverty_fundraiser">Blog Action Day Poverty Fund</a> so it shows that you can help.</p>
<h3>What can you do now?</h3>
<p>Blog and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/blogactionday">Twitter</a> about it, let others know about Blog Action Day and line up a story to be posted on October 15th too. Register your blog and get more information by going to the official <a href="http://www.blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day website</a>.</p>
<p>You could also <a href="http://www.blogactionday.org/badges/en">add a banner</a> to the side of your blog such as the one you see on the right side bar of Just Creative Design.</p>

<p>Thought I would share with you a recent project of mine: the rebranding of <em>The Murray Raine Puppets</em> logo and website.</p>
<blockquote><p>Murray Raine grew up in Newcastle, New South Wales. His initial interest and love of puppetry was triggered at the early age of six. Following a performance by the iconic “Marionette Theatre Of Australia” at Waratah Infants school, he new a career in puppetry was his destiny! Now four decades later Murray is regarded as Australia’s leading “cabaret” marionettist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please feel free to have a look through the <a href="http://murrayraine.homestead.com/index.html" target="_blank">old</a> and <a href="http://puppetcabaret.com" target="_blank">new</a> websites and let me know what you think. It was a real pleasure designing for Murray and his star studded cast.</p>

<h3>The 960 Grid</h3>
<p>When designing for the web, it&#8217;s often a good idea to follow a grid based approach. I personally use the <a href="http://960.gs/">960 grid system</a> and highly recommend it. Below you can see how I have used the 16 column grid system to build a structured and stylistically coherent web site.</p>
<p>You can click on the images below to see them at full resolution.</p>
<p>960 Grid System - 16 column grid with guides.</p>

<p>Over the past few months I&#8217;ve been storing the emails that have made me raise my eyebrow. Some rude, some funny, some odd and some you just can&#8217;t help but cringe at.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve left all formatting as it was received and it goes with out saying, I&#8217;ve made each email anonymous. I&#8217;ve also provided some general commentary just in case any of the authors are reading.</p>
<p><em>Please note that my comments are all just for a bit of fun are not meant to offend.<span id="more-4123"></span></em></p>
<blockquote><p>hey jacob<br />

<blockquote><p>Hi. I really would love to know what software you used to design your website. I am thinking of being a website designer and I really like the feel of your website. I just have a copy of Frontpage 2002 and it seems out of date. Thanks!</p>

<p>Yes, he said the F word.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first [logo] I have a small budget for. The second, which I can guarantee I will come back to you for if you give me a deal on the first, I will have a larger budget for, at least double. If you produce really good work and the stars align, larger partner opportunities may exist, which would offer you enormous exposure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow. Think they need a bit of talking to from <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/08/23/pay-the-creator/">Henry Ellison</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.logodesignlove.com/15-wonderfully-simple-logo-designs">Simplicity in logo design</a> is what makes a logo memorable and easier to recognise, but is there such thing as a too simple logo?</p>
<p>There has been a discussion over on <a href="http://logooftheday.com/2009-09-09-icvbook/">Logo Of The Day</a> about this logo in question, many love it, many hate it. What is your opinion?</p>
<h3>Background Info</h3>
<p>Below is the information that Anne Wehr of iCVBook submitted to Logo Of The Day. <a href="http://www.tomskipp.com/">Tom Skipp</a> is the designer of the logo.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<a href="http://www.icvbook.com/">iCVBook</a> is a new generation of professional network, including an innovation called iCV : a revolutionary professional identity for people and companies. It gathers together your online and professional, social and personal identities to give everyone the best image possible. The logo is for representing the brand.</p>
<p>We needed two different types of logo: the brand one and an icon that will be used by users for their iCVs. So this concept allows to decline the logo.</p>
<p>One represents a kind of sheet of paper, a Curriculum Vitae, a file to fill in. Simple and qualitative. With the possibility to play with the color of the corner (using the colorful pantone of the website) for gif animation or declination.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, when is a logo too simple?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently had the pleasure of designing the <a href="http://www.alistbloggingbootcamps.com/">A-List Blogging Bootcamps</a> logo for Mary Jaksch of <a href="http://writetodone.com">Write To Done</a> and Leo Babauta of <a href="http://zenhabits.net/">Zen Habits</a> and in this article I will guide you through my design process of creating the logo as seen above.</p>
<p><em>This article was originally written for those enrolled in the A-List Blogging Bootcamp and has been edited for display on Just Creative Design.<br />
</em></p>
<h3>A Brief Introduction</h3>
<p>A-List Blogging Bootcamp is <span class="il">a website that offers</span> series of short, live, online training courses for bloggers. For more information, please check out the <a href="http://www.alistbloggingbootcamps.com/">A-List Blogging Bootcamps</a> website.</p>
<h3>Getting The Job</h3>
<p>Mary first approached me after getting a referral from <a href="http://menwithpens.ca/">James Chatrand</a> about my design services. After Mary had checked out my <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/portfolio/">logo design portfolio</a> and told me what she needed, I directed her to my <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/hire-me/">logo design questionnaire</a> which allowed me to accurately quote for the job at hand.</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>After the paper work was out of the way, it was time to start researching for Mary and Leo&#8217;s logo design. This included looking up their competitors, researching their industry and searching for other logos of similar context.</p>
<h3>Brainstorming &amp; Conceptualising</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-852" title="alist-sketches-small" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/alist-sketches-small.jpg" alt="alist-sketches-small" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>After the majority of the research had been completed, it was <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/11/27/2007/12/27/how-to-boost-your-creativity/">time to get creative</a>. Based on the design brief and research conducted, this is where I let my ideas run wild. I <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2007/11/26/how-to-be-creative/">brainstormed</a> and sketched down my ideas and then experimented with them on the computer. I also had breaks between these sessions so I could reflect on the designs and have a fresh perspective - this is a crucial part of the <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/02/01/logo-design-process-of-top-graphic-designers/">logo design process</a>.</p>
<p>When conceptualising, some designers get too concerned with the graphic style and image of a piece (ie. try to depict exactly what the business does) while others such as myself try to convey a deeper meaning or some sort of visual puzzle into the logo. A good example of this would be the well known <a href="http://logodesignerblog.com/lindon-leader-the-man-behind-the-fedex-logo/">FedEx logo, designed by Lindor Leader</a>&#8230; did you know about the hidden arrow found between the E and X?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853" title="fed-ex" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/fed-ex.jpg" alt="fed-ex" width="500" height="322" /></p>
<p>For the A-List Blogging Bootcamp logo I also wanted to create a visual puzzle. Before reading on, try having a look at the completed A-List Blogging logo below&#8230; what do you see?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-854" title="a-list-blogging-bootcamps-logo" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/a-list-blogging-bootcamps-logo3.gif" alt="a-list-blogging-bootcamps-logo" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p>Do you see a star? A man? The letter A? A man above a podium? A light shining onto a man? A globe? These things mentioned are all open to a matter of interpretation though I am sure you will see at least a few.</p>
<p>All of these symbols have meaning that relate back to the A-List Blogging Bootcamp&#8217;s purpose. The star symbolises being a star (think A-List celebrity), a man symbolises a blogger, the letter A is a reference to the blog title, the light shining down onto the man shows that the blogger is the limelight, etc. You can look into as much as you like - it&#8217;s all up to your interpretation.</p>
<h3>Logo Variations</h3>
<p>When creating a logo design, there is a lot that goes on behind the scenes that one usually never sees&#8230; below you can see some of my many experimentations and logo variations. Please keep in mind that these are just my experimentations and were not shown to Mary or anyone except myself.</p>
<p>At this stage I work without colour to ensure I focus on the shape and concept of the logo, not the subjective &amp; distractive nature of colour.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-855" title="logo-variations-black" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/logo-variations-black.gif" alt="logo-variations-black" width="500" height="436" /></p>
<h3>Colour</h3>
<p>After a lot more experimentation and liaison with Mary, the logo was narrowed down to six variations. From here, I experimented with colour choices and narrowed it down to a burnt orange, grey and white colour scheme which Mary loved. The colour scheme reflects the site&#8217;s purpose quite well making it fresh, vibrant and authoritative.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-856" title="variations-black" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/variations-black.gif" alt="variations-black" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p>Above you can see the logos in black and then the burnt orange variations below.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-857" title="variations-colour" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/variations-colour.gif" alt="variations-colour" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<p>I presented what I thought was the strongest logo (the middle bottom logo) to Mary &amp; Leo and this was their reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>We both love it!</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-860" title="a-list-blogging-bootcamps-logo" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/a-list-blogging-bootcamps-logo5.gif" alt="a-list-blogging-bootcamps-logo" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<h3>Typeface</h3>
<p>After the logo was completed it was time to work on the typeface. After a lot of experimentation, I opted for the skillfully crafted <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-meta/bold-caps/">FF Meta Bold Caps</a>. This typeface was chosen to complement the rounded logo and to show that the blog was authoritative, not via the use of capital letters but via the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_caps">Small Caps</a> (a way to prevent capitalised words from appearing too large).</p>
<p>The emphasis of the text was placed on the words &#8220;A-List Blogging&#8221; with a complement colour of grey for the word &#8220;bootcamps&#8221;. This was done to split the rather long name up into easier-to-read sections which in turn, make the logo easier to implement on the <a href="http://www.alistbloggingbootcamps.com/">A-List Blogging Bootcamp&#8217;s</a> website. (The web designer slightly adjusted the logo on the website so it appears different to what you see here.)</p>
<h3>Final Logo Design</h3>
<p>Below you can see the final A-List Blogging Bootcamps logo.

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-861" title="a-list-blogging-bootcamps" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/a-list-blogging-bootcamps2.gif" alt="a-list-blogging-bootcamps" width="500" height="250" /></p>
<h3>Testimonial</h3>
<p>Here is what Mary had to say about her time working with me:</p>
<blockquote><p><img class="size-full wp-image-3221 alignleft" title="Mary Jaksch" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/mary.jpg" alt="Mary Jaksch" width="125" height="125" /><br />
&#8220;I struck lucky with Jacob Cass: his logo design process is intelligent and intuitive. The finished product is a splendid logo with many layers of meanings - all condensed into one image. If you are looking for a logo design, entrust yourself to Jacob. The end result will be not only a striking and beautiful logo, but one that carries all the subliminal messages you want to convey. It doesn’t get any better than this.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Comments are welcome, as always.</p>

<p>Stepping out of college and into the world of design can be a big change for many with little real-world experience in the field. Learning <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2007/12/08/worst-graphic-design-clients/">how to deal with clients</a>, manage projects, and <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/03/27/how-to-get-freelance-design-jobs-for-students/">find work</a> can be challenge for the rookie designer, especially with freelance work. These basic business tips can help prevent major disasters and set the stage for future success in the field.</p>
<h3>1. Always get a contract.</h3>
<p>It isn&#8217;t uncommon to get hooked up with a friend of a family member and in these cases you may not feel it&#8217;s necessary to ask for or get a contract, after all, you know the person. This is where trouble can start. Always lay out what the expectations for the client are and your fees ahead of time so there can be no question later as to what the agreement was.</p>

</ul>
<h3>2. Ask for a down payment.</h3>
<p>Inevitably you will have clients who are reluctant to shell out for the work that you&#8217;ve done for them, offering a myriad of excuses. Getting half the money up front will ensure you&#8217;re not left penniless while trying to get what you&#8217;re owed and that the client won&#8217;t leave you hanging partway through. 25-50% is a fair amount.</p>
<h3>3. Limit revisions.</h3>
<p>As with any creative project, there are a limitless amount of revisions that can be made. Some clients will be very picky and involved in the process and want to see numerous revisions of an idea. While there&#8217;s not necessarily anything wrong with wanting the best, make sure you&#8217;re getting compensated for it by placing a limit on the number of revisions or charging if they go over a certain number.</p>
<h3>4. Get organized.</h3>
<p>It will be incredibly difficult to manage one project, let alone multiples, and your life to boot if you don&#8217;t get organized now. Set up places to file important paper, organize your email inbox and make sure you&#8217;ve got plenty of room to store all your client work.</p>

</ul>
<h3>5. Work your network.</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/development/15-freelancer-design-and-development-creative-job-boards/">Finding work</a> can sometimes be the hardest part of working freelance. When you&#8217;re first <a href="http://designm.ag/freelance/starting-freelance-business/">starting out</a>, try using your personal connections to find yourself some work. <a href="http://www.thedesigncubicle.com/2009/07/tips-for-new-designers-to-gain-real-world-experience/">Ask family, friends, classmates</a> and associates if they know anyone who could benefit from your services. Most of the time, this will turn up at least one lead and get you started working.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee of entrepreneurial success in any venture, but taking steps to plan for the future and better manage work today certainly won&#8217;t hurt even the most experienced designers and can be a great way to start a career for newbies.

<p>This is a general update of my future plans, articles I&#8217;ve written elsewhere and links to connect with me.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s Official - I&#8217;m Moving to NYC!</h3>
<p>I posted about <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/07/24/aussie-goes-nyc/">my new job in NYC</a> at <a href="http://carrotcreative.com">Carrot Creative</a> a few weeks ago though only on the weekend did I get my US Working Visa approved. Everything is set (except accommodation) and the flight is booked for January 2010 which is when I will begin work. An exciting move indeed!</p>
<h3>Articles Written Elsewhere</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve written a rather extensive article on <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/26/vital-tips-for-effective-logo-design/">Vital Tips for Effective Logo Design</a> over on <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/"><em>Smashing Magazine</em></a>.</p>
<p>In the latest issue of <em><a href="http://www.computerarts.co.uk/">Computer Arts</a></em> magazine (Issue 166), I wrote their feature cover article on Cross Media Design including tips for using Photoshop with Illustrator, Dreamweaver and InDesign. The tips for After Affects, Premiere &amp; Flash were written by someone else. The magazine is on sale now. Stay tuned for the next issue of CA too, as I&#8217;ve written a logo design tutorial.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also got an article in the latest issue of <a href="http://www.layersmagazine.com/magazine"><em>Layers Magazine</em></a> (August/ September Issue) that goes through the design process for my <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/gallery/print-design/vero-water-bottle-3d.jpg">Vero logo and bottle design</a>. I&#8217;ve previously written for Layers, including the cover article <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/01/10/my-cover-article-in-layers-magazine-negative-space/">Negative Space</a> back in January and an Illustrator tutorial on &#8216;How To Create A <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/gallery/personal-work/comic-sans-monster.gif">Font Monster</a>&#8216; in July. I was also featured as their <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/05/28/instant-inspiration-student-mobiles/">Designer In The Spotlight</a> in the May / June issue.</p>
<p>I will post each of the articles on this blog after the magazines go off sale.</p>

<p>In this article I will guide you through how I designed a &#8220;custom car vehicle wrap&#8221; along with tips I learned along the way&#8230; but before I launch into that, I would like you to meet Caroline, Luke&#8217;s new company car.</p>

<p>Now that you have been introduced, let me begin&#8230;</p>
<h3>1. Do The Research</h3>
<p>Before you start any new project, you should get familiar with the process and subject matter and as this was my first time doing a car vehicle wrap, this was even more important.</p>
<p>As I couldn&#8217;t find much information on the web or have any idea where to begin, I asked my Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/justcreative">follow me</a>) followers if they had any tips or resources and that was a huge help, along with asking the print shop directly.</p>
<p>It was also handy to read the FAQ&#8217;s on these three sites: <a href="http://www.motagraphics.com.au/faq.html">MotaGraphics</a>, <a href="http://www.adsonwheels.com/FAQs/">AdsOnWheels</a>, <a href="http://www.skinzwraps.com/faq.html">SkinzWraps</a> and the getting started section on <a href="http://www.carwraps.net/">CarWraps.net</a>. Remember that your printer may have different requirements than these shops so it&#8217;s best to ask your printer for their special requirements.</p>
<h3>2. Buy / Create The Outlines</h3>
<p>The first step of the process is to create the outlines for the car <em>to scale</em>, as this is what you will need to provide to the printers.</p>
<p>I asked my Twitter followers if they had the outline for Luke&#8217;s Toyota Carolla 2009 Hatchback though this was to no avail (though 4 people did send the 2003 version) so this meant I had to create the outlines myself.</p>
<p>Before you go about creating the outlines yourself, check to see if these places stock your particular car.</p>
<p><strong>Places to find car vehicle outlines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bittennails.com/free-car-vector-outlines-6000-of-them">6000 Free Car Outlines</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.thebadwrap.mobi/">The Bad Wrap</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.unleash.com/ddw/vehicle-templates/">Car &amp; Truck Pro Vehicle Outlines 2009</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.digitalauto.on.ca/">Digital Auto</a> (send them an email)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can not find the vehicle wrap for your particular car model you will have to create the outlines yourself and to scale.</p>
<p>Below you can see how <a href="http://blackpixi.com/">Kyle Anthony</a> explained the process to me.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ok, basically, when I layout a vehicle I&#8217;m doing a wrap on, if the vehicle isn&#8217;t already in one of my templates from a collection of vehicle templates from a company called <a href="http://www.thebadwrap.mobi/">The Bad Wrap</a>, I&#8217;ll take a good side profile photograph of the vehicle and bring it into Photoshop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Below you can see the original side photos of Luke&#8217;s 2009 Carolla that he took himself.</p>

<p>Kyle continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once you&#8217;ve taken the photos, here are the steps to laying it out so you can design at a reasonable pace with such a large file. This is for car wrap designs that are in raster format as apposed to vector.</p>
<p>1. Measure the distance of anything you can use as a reference point for scaling on the vehicle, this could be the distance of a door handle, door window, wheel, anything that you can use as a measurement.</p>
<p>2. With the side photograph of the vehicle in Photoshop, and all of your measuring tools set to inches, (also make sure your info palette is up F8) measure with the ruler tool, the distance of whatever you measured in the 1st step in one tenth scale. Do this by scaling the image size of the photograph down to make it match up. Not the canvas size.</p>
<p>3. So if you measured the wide of a door handle as lets say 7 inches wide, your info palette with the ruler tool active should measure the door handle to be .7inches wide.</p>
<p>4. Once you get this done, change the ppi of the document to 720ppi.  When designing a wrap, a popular way to design at an appropriate scale without slowing down your machine is at 1/10th scale.  Once the wrap is done and the design is ready to be set to print, flatten the document, and save it as a non compressed tiff.  When you send it to print, or &#8220;rip&#8221; it, make sure to print it at 1000x scale.</p>
<p>5. Once you rip it at the 1000x scale, the wrap will print at 72dpi, the minimal acceptable resolution for printing a wrap so that you get acceptable results, and acceptable performance when designing and printing it.  This also cuts down on the ripping time, or the time it takes from when you hit &#8220;print&#8221; and from the time it actually starts printing.  On very large jobs, I&#8217;ve had ripping time take excess of 4 hours.</p>
<p>6. That&#8217;s pretty much it, the same process can be used for all sides of the vehicle, just make sure you work off of good square photographs of the vehicle, and if you have any questions at all, email me!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are designing in vector format, you will not have to worry about the DPI, but the outlines should still be to scale.</p>
<p>Below you can see the outlines of the 2009 Carolla Hatchback to scale.</p>

<h3>3. Gather Inspiration</h3>
<p>As with any project, it&#8217;s a good idea to know what is out there first before you begin. I&#8217;ve found a few car wrap galleries to be of assistance:</p>
<p><strong>Car / truck vehicle wrap inspiration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.carwraps.net/gallery/">Car Wrap Gallery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.adsonwheels.com/option,com_zoom/Itemid,92/">Vinyl Vehicle Wrap Gallery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/skinzwraps">SkinzWraps</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.altapac.com/index.php/gallery">AltaPac Car Wrap Gallery</a> (the print shop we used)</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Create The Design</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s probably a wise idea to sketch out some ideas before you jump straight onto the computer. Print out a few thumbnailed copies of the outlined car and start working on your designs.</p>
<p>After you have some rough ideas, you can go into Illustrator and draft up your proposed designs on the car. Personally I found working on the photos a bit easier than the outlined versions of the car. I also set the photo opacity at 50% so I could see the car and colour at the same time.</p>
<p>Below you can see the mockup with the photos set at 50% opacity.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/50opacity.jpg" alt="50 Opacity" width="500" height="337" /></p>
<p>Below you can see the mockup set at 100% opacity.</p>

<h3>5. Recreate To Scale</h3>
<p>After you have finished with the photo mockup, you should create it to scale on your outlined version and send it to the print shop. This step may or may not be necessary depending on your print store.</p>
<p>The print shop will take it from here and create the file ready for print.</p>
<h3>6. Prepare For Print</h3>
<p>After giving the mockup files to the printer, they create the design into a 2D format, ready for print. Below you can see what a similar project for a Ute looked like, just before going to print. The green lines are the separate sections that got stretched or wrapped around the Ute. Below this you can see the final result.</p>

<p>Caroline had a similar process and after the project was complete I asked Matt if he could explain exactly how he went about doing the wrap for Caroline. Matt kindly obliged and below you can find his tips and explanation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here are the file I used to print and the files I used to set the files up ready for print. [Matt attached several PDFs]</p>
<p>I can’t say how I did it, is the way it is done through-out the industry (not really sure how they do it elsewhere) but I have found this method the best for myself and for our applicator. I will explain a few things just here and some of the things we normally do in case you need to do a design for next time.</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/printsections.jpg" alt="Print Sections" width="500" height="327" /></p>
<p>Above you can see how each section of the car was applied, to scale.</p>
<p>Matt continues&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Firstly as you will be able to see that we had to include the rear bumper bar into each side section print [1]. This is because you had a gradient coming out from the rear wheel going over the rear bar and up and around the rear quarter panel. As you can see it is able to be done but we had to run a center join line in the rear bar to accommodate for this effect [2]. We normally print the rear bar as one piece so there is no need for a join line as we trim it off where the bumper bar meets the body. Because of the gradient effect we could not do this as it would have been impossible to match the gradient sections up at the wheel and where the body meets the rear bar because of stretching of the material and the like. We then had to cut the slogan in vinyl lettering which is no big deal but if we could have printed the rear bar in one section, we would have most likely included the slogan in the print to avoid applying it later.</p>
<p>The gradient sections [4] that were in the design I could not oversize properly as they were cropped images so I reproduced them myself so I could over size them. We have to oversize the print so it can wrap under sections and not fall short in parts as the many curves in cars can bring you unstuck and can cause headaches in the application process. I know firsthand from my mistakes thinking that I over sized enough but when it came to but it on the car it has just made it with some stretching. Like the piece I printed up for the rear tail gate of the corolla. I thought I gave them heaps to play with only to find out it only just fitted with some more stretching. Whoops.</p>
<p>You will notice this in the files I have sent you where and how much I over sized the print [See how far the print goes over the edge of the car &amp; wheels, in particular the bottom edge]</p>
<p>Another point to look out for in parts of the car that are difficult to wrap. Bellow the doors and complex cut outs and deep recesses in front bumper bars. They can be done but possibly not and may require the design being cut up into a few pieces. In the instance of your design I tried to keep it much to your specifications as possible. This meant laying part of the design over the door handles. It’s not a big problem in cars that have flush fitting door handles but with the corolla and many new cars the door handles protrude out meaning there is a bit of conforming to do around and on the door handle with the sticker and not to mention the wear and tear that comes from grabbing the door handle all the time. If possible I try not to run the design over the door handles or place parts of the writing around the handles.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hope that gave you an insight into how the car wrap was applied.</p>
<h3>7. Apply The Graphics</h3>
<p>After printing, the print shop will literally wrap the 2D graphics around the car, section by section. For the One Fine Day Photography car, it was split into 6 separate wraps; one for each side, two for the bumper, one for the tailgate and one for the top of the car. The text and the logo on the front of the car were not wrapped but were stuck on like stickers.</p>
<h3>8. Admire</h3>
<p>As when any work comes back from print, you just have to admire it&#8230; but sadly, I am yet to meet Caroline or Luke for that matter though I hope to do so very soon - they only live one suburb away after all.</p>
<p>I should also take this time to send my congratulations to Luke &amp; Michelle (Luke&#8217;s wife) for their newly first born son, <a href="http://ofdphoto.com/2009/08/07/snuggly/">Josiah</a>!</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/carvehiclewrapdesign-4.jpg" alt="Car Vehicle Wrap Design" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<h3>A Cohesive Brand</h3>
<p>You can see how the whole brand works together - car, business card, website, twitter profile, etc.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/photographybusinesscard.jpg" alt="Photography Business Card" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<p>Below is Luke&#8217;s Twitter profile, designed by Luke himself. A nice job I&#8217;ll say!</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/twitterprofile.jpg" alt="Twitter Profile" width="500" height="467" /></p>
<h3>Testimonial</h3>
<p>Below you can read the <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/hire-me/testimonials">testimonial</a> Luke gave after completing his logo design.</p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignleft" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/luke-arms.jpg" border="0" alt="Luke Arms" hspace="0" align="baseline" />I hired Jacob to design a new logo for One Fine Day Photography. It was my first time working with a professional designer, and I couldn’t have been happier. From beginning to end, it was clear that he wanted to deliver a logo that would achieve my aims for it while providing a tangible connection with my current branding, encapsulating the core values of my business and designing a piece of art that we could both be proud of.</p>
<p>None of those things can be rushed, and although I was impressed with Jacob’s turnaround, I had no doubt that he was extremely thorough in researching my business and market, experimenting with a variety of designs, and preparing his concepts for my feedback. I wasn’t easy to please when it came to finding a design I loved, but Jacob was exceptionally accommodating with all of my requests (including the silly ones) and within a few days we had arrived at a design I could accept without hesitation.</p>
<p>Jacob might only be in his early twenties, but his giftedness as a designer and his command of doing business in the 21st century are clearly evident in the international following he has gained within the design community. This speaks volumes of the quality of his work and the passion he has for it. I cannot recommend him highly enough.</p></blockquote>
<h3>A Final Word</h3>
<p>I would like to close with this quote from <a href="http://hugoandmarie.com/">Jennifer Sims</a> found in Issue 165 of <a href="http://www.computerarts.co.uk/">Computer Arts</a> magazine.</p>
<blockquote><p>Take on intimidating projects - fall into holes and you&#8217;ll learn more when you&#8217;re forced to claw your way out.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I first took on this project, I had never done a car wrap design before, though after putting my claws into it, I really did learn a lot! So yeah, take on intimidating projects - the worst you could do is improve.</p>
<p>What do you think of the final car wrap design? Have you ever worked on something similar? Have any questions or tips to add?</p>

<blockquote><p>I always get emails from people wanting design work from me either for free or next to nothing. This is quite an insult, since I am a professional designer. Personally I think a lot of people really don’t understand what a graphic designer does, because what we produce isn’t a tangible object you can hold in your hands (like say groceries or a new HDTV) and so it’s easy to assume that it doesn’t have much value or that it’s easy to do. My hope is that people will <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/05/22/why-logo-design-does-not-cost-5-dollars/">read Jacob’s article</a> and come away with a better understanding of the designing process and the people who make such designs.</p></blockquote>

<p>Throughout June and July I was on vacation travelling through Japan, Cambodia, Vietnam and New Zealand and as usual with any major trip, I share the photos and stories with you.</p>
<p>I posted the <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/07/25/kingdom-of-cambodia/">Cambodia</a> photos a few weeks back and now I&#8217;ve finally had the chance to go  through the Vietnam photos.</p>
<p>Circled in green below, you can see the places travelled to in Vietnam: Mekong Delta, Ho Chi Minh City, Cu Chi, Nha Trang, Hoi An, Hue, Hanoi, Halong Bay and Sapa along with Siem Riep &amp; Phnom Penh in Cambodia.<span id="more-4082"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4087" title="Vietnam" src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam.jpg" alt="Vietnam" width="400" height="677" /></p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (11).jpg" alt="" width="499" height="374" /></p>
<p>This was the group I traveled with throughout Vietnam. I went through the travel company Contiki on their <a href="http://contiki.com.au/tours/218-vietnam-explorer">Vietnam Explorer</a> tour. Contiki has a very strong Aussie backing (though is UK owned) and is aimed at the 18-35 year old traveler. High energy and endurance is a must.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (4).jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" /></p>
<p>This is snake wine. Rice wine soaked with snakes, spiders and scorpions.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (5).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Me drinking the snake rice wine. It was pretty bitter, with a rather strong &#8220;bitey&#8221; flavour.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (6).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Fish for lunch!</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (7).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Housing along the river.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (1).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Floating market, each of these boats sell different goods. This photo doesn&#8217;t do the markets justice but there were hundreds of these boats each with their own goods.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (3).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Rice paper making - a family owned business.</p>

<p>Bike riding throughout the Mekong Delta. This was rather scary as the paths were tiny (about quarter of the size of the path above). At one stage we were riding over bridges about 1 foot wide and you had water on one side and barbed wire on the other. Very safe indeed.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (9).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>A huge snake, and yes I do have a Bomber Man t shirt. I got it in Japan a few weeks earlier.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (12).jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" /></p>
<p>We had to get these boats to get to our guest house. Tried rowing myself - it&#8217;s a lot harder than you think!</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (13).jpg" alt="" width="374" height="499" /></p>
<p>Being a goof.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (14).jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" /></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%E1%BB%A7_Chi_tunnels">Cu Chi tunnels</a> - a huge underground network of tunnels that housed the Viet Cong&#8217;s base of operations throughout the war.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (15).jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" /></p>
<p>Me trying to fit in the tunnel - only just and with a lot of effort.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (16).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>One of the jungle booby traps used in the Vietnam War or what the Vietnamese call the &#8220;American War&#8221;.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (17).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Shooting a machine gun. Man was it loud!</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (18).jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" /></p>
<p>Crawling through the tunnels. This is actually double the size of the original tunnel - this particular one was built for tourists.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (19).jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" /></p>
<p>Bombshells from the war.</p>

<p>Huge tank at the War Museum.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (21).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve definitely got bigger guns, ahem.</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (22).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Just one of the disturbing images found at the Vietnam War Museum.</p>
<p><strong>Update: 22/8/09</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This is a wide known photo in Vietnam and it is a Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken during the Vietnam War. The girl in this picture is Kim Phúc - one of many victims of Napalm bomb, this photo shows her at about age nine running naked on the street after being severely burned on her back by a South Vietnamese napalm attack.”</p>
<p><em>Thanks to TuanAnh for the above information.</em></p>

<p>Ordered chaos - telephone and electricity wires.</p>

<p>2 Lobsters, 500grams of King Prawns and 2 beers for AUD$25. (I hadn&#8217;t eaten all day) Now that is what I call a bargain!</p>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vietnam/vietnam-photos (102).jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>You can tell I was enjoying it.</p>

<p>The Fish Tank is one lethal drink!</p>

<p>While &#8220;relaxing&#8221; on the beach, little kids come around to you and sell stuff, but we ended up taking it off them and selling it back to them (all in good fun). They were in stitches.</p>

<p>Each of those red lanterns are actually burning coils that last for a month and give good luck and wishes to people who leave them there.</p>

<p>The one on the right gave me a friendship band, made similar to the pattern on her  red/yellow bag. Cute.</p>

<p>The crew who came on the 18km trek though Sapa. This was probably my highlight of the tour, it was such a great experience, though bloody hot!</p>

<p>The end of the trek had this very refreshing &amp; beautiful waterfall / stream.</p>

<p><a href="http://logolounge.com">Logo Lounge</a> has long been one of my favourite <a href="http://logodesignerblog.com/top-best-10-logo-design-inspiration-galleries/">logo design inspiration galleries</a> so whenever they release a new book, I know I won&#8217;t be disappointed. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LogoLounge-International-Identities-Designers-Logolounge/dp/1592535275">Logo Lounge Volume 5</a> was no exception.</p>
<p>Below you can read the description of this great logo design book:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fifth volume in the best-selling LogoLounge series provides 2,000 totally new logos from designers worldwide. This book, like the previous titles in the series, is compiled in association with LogoLounge.com, a website that was launched by Bill Gardner in 2002. The site is dedicated to logos. Top designers and design firms are handpicked and invited to be “foundation members.” Foundation and website members each supply multiple logos to the site. Each LogoLounge book presents new logos that have been added to the site, providing designers with an invaluable source for design inspiration and a resource for design solutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last year I was lucky enough to be picked as one of their &#8220;foundation members&#8221; and after submitting several of my logos, two were chosen to be featured in Logo Lounge Volume 5. You can see the photos below.</p>
<p>What I like about this book is that it not only features logo designs sorted by category, but it also features whole logo design case studies from high profile design agencies such as <a href="http://www.cgstudionyc.com/">Chermayeff &amp; Geismar</a> and <a href="http://www.cato.com.au/">Cato Purnell</a>. In particular, I quite enjoyed reading through the <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_kangaroo_with_more_power.php">Qantas</a> and <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/person_or_apple_discuss.php">Woolworths</a> rebrandings.</p>
<p>Anyway, I highly recommend you to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LogoLounge-International-Identities-Designers-Logolounge/dp/1592535275">check out this book</a> and while your at it, you may like to read about my other <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2009/06/15/logo-design-books/">logo design book recommendations</a>.</p>

<p>In this article I outline the so called &#8220;pros&#8221; and cons of <a href="http://no-spec.com/">speculative work</a> and then outline other&#8217;s opinions on the debate&#8230; If you haven&#8217;t already guessed it, I am against spec work. Let me explain - it&#8217;s worth the read.</p>
<h3><span id="more-3930"></span><strong>What is &#8220;spec work&#8221;?</strong></h3>
<p>Speculative work (or free pitching) is any job for which the client expects to see examples or a finished piece of design before agreeing to pay a fee or compensation.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;crowdsourcing&#8221; is sometimes used however this is <strong>not</strong> spec work, however, some do use this term to cover up the fact that what they are actually offering is spec work. Do not let this vernacular term deceive you.</p>
<h3><strong>Difference  between spec work and crowdsourcing:</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>Crowdsourcing:</strong></em> &#8220;Vote for our new logo, we will use the one you all like the most!&#8221; This means the logos have already been designed (and hopefully not via spec).</p>
<p><em><strong>Spec or Free Pitching:</strong></em> &#8220;We need a logo, someone design one for us and we will pick the one we like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spec work is a lose, lose situation. Let me explain why.</p>
<h3><strong>What is wrong with spec work?</strong></h3>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image-269.jpg" alt="No Spec" width="500" height="134" /></p>
<p>While a client may feel they don’t want to invest money until seeing some work, designers should not have to prove their worth (do spec) to get a job, though this is the least part of the worry. Instead, clients should choose a designer based on their portfolio and experience and commit to building a working relationship with him or her. Only then will both the client and designer see the <em>best</em> results.</p>
<p>On a side note, talking on behalf of all designers, I would like to say that if a client can&#8217;t look at a designer&#8217;s <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/portfolio/">style and quality of work</a> (let alone the <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/about/#awards">awards</a>, <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/hire-me/testimonials/">testimonials</a> or <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/about#education">education</a>) and put trust in their services, then they are usually not a client you want to do business with. Developing a working business relationship is all about educating the client and building trust.</p>
<h3><strong>An example of spec work: Design Contests</strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;Design contests&#8221; are one of the most common forms of spec and one of the <a href="http://buildinternet.com/2009/01/the-real-problems-with-design-contests/">most dangerous</a>. A company will put out a request for a design (eg. a logo design) inviting anyone and everyone to submit work. Often hundreds of designers will submit a design, but only the chosen work, the winner, will be paid&#8230; and that is <a href="http://www.specwatch.info/99j3.html">not even guaranteed</a> - <a href="http://www.specwatch.info/el13J22.html">even on prepaid contests</a>.</p>
<p>Let me explain the negatives of this situation for both clients and designers.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Pros&#8221; For Clients Using Spec</h3>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image-9.gif" alt="Pros for clients" width="500" height="134" /></p>
<p>Before looking at all the negatives of spec work, some claim that there are positive sides to designing on spec. I want to examine the so called &#8220;pros&#8221; of why consumers (those that need the designs) are attracted to using design contests and suggest reasons why these pros really are not so &#8220;pro&#8221;.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Cheaper&#8221; Cost &amp; More Variations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the main attractions of using spec work is the so called &#8220;cheaper cost&#8221; &amp; the fact you get more variations &amp; ideas. The typical scenario goes &#8220;Wow, I can get 200 different variations for $500&#8243;. On the surface, this may appear cheaper however if you dig deeper you will find that this - in nearly every case - is not so.</p>
<p>Please read on to view the many cons of designing via spec.</p>
<h3>Cons For Clients Using Spec</h3>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image-8.gif" alt="Cons for clients" width="500" height="134" /></p>
<p>Summarised below are 11 cons for clients designing via spec. These 11 pointers are explained in more depth below this summary.</p>
<ol>
<li>Chance Of Plagiarised Work</li>
<li>Unoriginal Ideas &amp; Designs</li>
<li>No Protection</li>
<li>Inferior Quality Designs</li>
<li>No Research or Development</li>
<li>Limited or No Revisions</li>
<li>Unproductive Time Wasting</li>
<li>The Client is not an Educated Design Professional</li>
<li>Unethical &amp; Immoral (and possibly Illegal)</li>
<li>Little Communication &amp; Involvement In The Design Process</li>
<li>You Build A Negative Relationship Built On Distrust</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Client negatives of spec work:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Chance Of Plagiarised Work</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the biggest reasons not to use design competitions is the fact that so many of the designs are copied from elsewhere. There have been <a href="http://www.thelogofactory.com/library/articles/design-logo-contests.html">numerous</a>, <a href="http://www.thelogofactory.com/copycats2.html">numerous</a> <a href="http://www.thelogofactory.com/copycats4.html">reports</a> on theft from elsewhere especially within the logo design industry.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this can get you into a lot of legal trouble if caught with plagiarised work.</p>
<p>And in some cases, &#8220;designers&#8221; (evil quotes there) are doing spec work with the intent of suing the company further down the road. I wonder how many people have ever thought about that?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2. Unoriginal Ideas &amp; Designs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>More often than not, designers who enter these contests are often using template work, which means the work is unoriginal and may have been used for another client. In <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2007/08/14/dont-design-on-spec/">some cases</a>, it can lead to problems many months down the track such as when a rejected design gets used for another contest. There are also <a href="http://www.specwatch.info/SWJ99d.html">numerous examples</a> of this happening to many unfortunate business owners.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3. No Protection</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most professional designers have an agreement or contract that they send to their clients&#8230; these contracts protect both the client and the designer while also establishing a trusting, working relationship. In nearly all jobs posted on design contest sites, there is <strong>no contract</strong> what so ever which leaves the client and designer at much higher risk throughout the whole design process. Who owns the copyright? What are the restrictions for the design? What are the terms and conditions?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4. Inferior Quality Designs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although you can find some great individual talent on design contest sites, the vast majority of the users have little or no knowledge of what &#8220;good&#8221; design actually is, let alone know how to communicate an intended message for your company. This raises the chance that the final output will be inferior to what could have been achieved by using a professional designer.</p>
<p>This leads me to the next point&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>5. No Research or Development</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most professional designers will have some form of questionnaire for clients to fill out to ensure that the final design will be reflective of the needs of the business and target market, unlike contest sites.</p>
<p>For an example see either my <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/09/26/how-to-write-an-effective-design-brief/">design brief page</a> or my <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/hire-me/">logo design questionnaire</a>.</p>
<p>Without these vital components, the &#8220;designer&#8221; is only producing decoration, not solving the problem of what the design should be communicating.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>6. Limited or No Revisions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Revision rounds are almost non-existent in the context of a contest. Sure, a contest winner could be hired again after being chosen to make a few changes, but in a true client-designer relationship this communication would be constant. The end result would be a collaboration instead of guesswork which also leads me to the next point&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>7.Unproductive Time Wasting</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Designing via contests takes a lot of time&#8230; a client will have to spend numerous hours commenting and looking through the submitted designs picking and choosing what the &#8220;best&#8221; design is which also leads me to the next point.</p>
<blockquote><p>The number of designers who aren’t making a penny, while entering dozens of contests, is in the tens of thousands, and you just need to look at the astonishing raw numbers for <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.specwatch.info/raw-numbers2.html" target="_blank">Crowdspring</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.specwatch.info/raw-numbers.html" target="_blank">99designs</a> to see for yourself. Wasted time, in terms of unpaid designs submitted, is, quite literally, in the hundreds of years. Yes, that’s hundreds. ~ <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/07/interview-with-specwatch-the-naked-truth-about-design-contests/">The Naked Truth</a></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li> <strong>8.You Are Not an Educated Design Professional</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When I say &#8220;you&#8221;, I mean the client wanting the design. The reason one hires a designer in the first place is due to the fact that they are after a professional looking piece of design - one that they could have not done them self. Alas the person needing the design is more than likely, <em>not a professional</em>.</p>
<p>So, how can a client choose the &#8220;best&#8221; piece of design if they do not even know the basics of design? The fact of the matter is, clients choose the &#8220;best&#8221; design based purely on style, nothing more. On top of this fact, do clients even know the technicalities &amp; visual issues of what is being presented?</p>
<p>ie. What is the difference between vector and bitmap generated designs? What is the <a href="http://www.epiphanymultimedia.com/faqs/details.cfm?id=3">difference between RGB, Pantone or CMYK</a> colours? What print, bleed &amp; trim settings are needed? etc.</p>
<p>The bottom line here is that most clients are unversed in what is really needed and they should be leaving this to a trained, experienced professional.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>9. Unethical &amp; Immoral (and possibly Illegal)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although not directly a con to the client, the fact of the matter is design contests are unethical &amp; immoral. Period.</p>
<p>The very fact that there is only one winner per contest means that the other (usually in the hundreds) designers will get no return for their hard work. To put this into perspective imagine a $500 contest with 100 entries. Second grade maths tells us that each entry is worth $5&#8230; that is below minimum wage and to make matters worse, the &#8216;losers&#8217; will not even receive that $5.</p>
<p>Essentially, design contests are like a lottery to the extent that <a href="http://www.thelogofactory.com/logo_blog/index.php/logo-design-contests-legal/">some even question the legalities of them</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10. Little Communication &amp; Involvement In The Design Process</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When working with a professional designer you collaborate together throughout the whole design process to achieve the desired outcome. From creating the first initial design brief, right through to the sketches, brainstorming, development, feedback, revisions and delivery.</p>
<p>When designing on spec, all you provide is a short (often less than a paragraph) design brief and then receive the design. There is no involvement&#8230; let alone after sale customer support.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>11. Negative Relationship Built On Distrust</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If potential clients are asking one or several designers to show work, they are immediately establishing a negative relationship. Instead of building a long lasting relationship with a single designer, they are often asking several to submit work with little contact between any of them.</p>
<p>If you are still not convinced, read this article for <a href="http://www.thelogofactory.com/logo_blog/index.php/crowdsource-new-logo-design/">16 more reasons why to NOT use design contests</a> or read some of <a href="http://www.specwatch.info/">SpecWatch</a> &#8217;s examples of design contests gone wrong.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Pros&#8221; For Designers Doing Spec</h3>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image-11.gif" alt="Pros for designers doing spec" width="500" height="134" /></p>
<p>The people who are &#8220;for&#8221; spec work often have these arguments saying why spec work is benefiting the world.</p>
<p><strong>They claim that contest sites provide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a world wide access &amp; equal playing field</li>
<li>a choice of work to choose from</li>
<li>a chance to gain experience</li>
<li>a chance to build your portfolio</li>
<li>a chance to gain a small monetary reward</li>
<li>a chance to gain more work</li>
<li>a chance to meet people</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But in nearly all cases, you can find this right on your doorstep, without working on spec&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>If a designer is wanting to <a href="http://blog.gb-studio.tv/2008/12/texts/designweds-build-a-better-portfolio">build up their portfolio</a> and do all of the above, all you need to do is approach your local non-profit organisation (or local businesses) and offer them your skills, free of charge.</p>
<p>This will give you experience, allow you to improve your customer relation skills, build up your business network all while giving back to the community and getting exposure for your work. There is also a chance that the organisation will pay you for your work and the work may lead you to more (paid) work too. It&#8217;s a win-win for all and <a href="http://www.thelogofactory.com/logo_blog/index.php/crowdsource-new-logo-design/">certainly not a waste of time</a> - like spec work.</p>
<h3>Cons For Designers Doing Spec</h3>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image-7.gif" alt="Cons for designers" width="500" height="134" /></p>
<p>Apart from all of the negatives mentioned above, there are numerous more reasons why designers should not participate in spec work.</p>
<ul>
<li>It devalues the design industry</li>
<li>There is a lot of work, with little, to no pay</li>
<li>There is no copyright or legal protection</li>
<li>The winning designs are chosen purely by the client&#8217;s personal taste</li>
<li>There is little interaction with the client</li>
<li>It is very time consuming</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grey Area: Volunteering / Pro Bono Work</h3>
<p><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image-283.jpg" alt="Grey" width="500" height="134" /></p>
<p>Volunteering is one area that you could is a &#8216;grey&#8217; area. <a href="http://www.aiga.org/">Jennifer Bender</a> from AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts) <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/position-spec-work#116499">answered</a> this question quite well in regards to AIGA using <em>volunteered</em> students for some of their design work. This response can be applied to the topic of volunteering &amp; pro bono work in general.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.aiga.org/">AIGA</a> works with designers and firms to create promotional materials including posters, event programs, event web sites, etc. <strong>AIGA’s policy is to always provide an honorarium for design projects as compensation</strong> . While we realize it is not set at market rates, it recognizes that no design should be expected without compensation. Implementation, such as printing costs, postage and paper, are covered by AIGA and/or an interested sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>The difference between this and speculative work is that our volunteer designers are never required to do work up front for free before a contract or project begins</strong>. Each designer knows explicitly beforehand the terms we are able to offer, which is meant as our demonstration that every designer’s work has significant value, knowing that there are both monetary and non-monetary considerations in any project. Designers typically send us a portfolio of their past work, then have the opportunity to review a design brief and accept or decline the project. At that time, <strong>a contract is executed with a commitment to an honorarium,</strong> after which work on the project begins.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h3>Official Association&#8217;s Views:</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.agda.com.au/"><strong>AGDA</strong></a> (Australian Graphic Design Association) also have a firm &#8220;no-spec&#8221; stance on the subject.</p>
<p>As quoted in the <a href="http://archive.agda.com.au/aboutagda/more/codeofethics.html">AGDA Code Of Ethics</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>4.1 Predatory pricing (free pitching)<br />
</strong></em>AGDA discourages members from predatory pricing practices such as free pitching, loss leading and other pricing below break-even. Members should be aware that such practices will damage the economic viability of their business.</p></blockquote>
<p>and then continues on with:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>6.2 Free pitching</em><br />
</strong>AGDA is unequivocally opposed to the unfair manipulation of designers with the aim of garnering unpaid work (commonly known as &#8216;free pitching&#8217;). Client practices which do damage to a member&#8217;s business are those that award projects or commissions on the basis of the commissioner&#8217;s acceptance of unpaid design submissions (eg. unpaid competitive tendering or speculative work)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.aiga.org/"><strong>AIGA</strong></a> (American Institute of Graphic Arts) also has a <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/position-spec-work">firm &#8220;no-spec&#8221; stance</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>AIGA believes that doing speculative work—that is, work done without compensation, for the client’s speculation—seriously compromises the quality of work that clients are entitled to and also violates a tacit, long-standing ethical standard in the communication design profession worldwide. AIGA strongly discourages the practice of requesting that design work be produced and submitted on a speculative basis in order to be considered for acceptance on a project.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new AIGA President, Debbie Millman <a href="http://www.no-spec.com/archives/interviewing-debbie-millman-president-of-the-national-aiga/">has her say on the spec topic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am personally vigorously, passionately and fundamentally AGAINST  designers being asked to do work on spec and neither I nor my firm will  ever participate in speculative work. I have said it before and I will  say it again: Speculative work denigrates both the agencies and the  designers that participate. If we give away our work for free, if we  give away our talent and our expertise, we give away more than the  work. We give away our souls.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>Other&#8217;s opinions against spec work:</h3>
<p>Many have spoken about their distaste of spec work before, including myself in the articles <a href="http://justcreativedesign.com/2008/05/22/why-logo-design-does-not-cost-5-dollars/">Why logo design does not cost $5.00</a> and <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/01/how-not-to-design-a-logo/">How NOT to design a logo</a>&#8230; below I quote &amp; link to just a few more designers who have spoken out against spec work.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Hyde</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is a major ethical flaw of both parties.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Steve from Logo Factory</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>{with a sarcastic tone} &#8220;Keep in mind that not winning any money after dozens of contests only makes designers try harder. That means, they’ll eventually get better at designing. And they’ll enter more contests that they won’t win. Which will get them even more exposure, helpful stars and comments. So, by not paying designers, you’re [clients] actually helping them be better designers. Strange as it seems, paying designers is bad. Makes them lazy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It insults everything about the real-world graphic design industry and the hard-working professionals that make a living building long-term client relationships, crafting deep and varied portfolios, and routinely putting their blood, sweat and tears into their work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;You, as the client, should know that your designer values your business. They’re not providing you with a design based purely on aesthetics, and one that took perhaps 30 minutes to create. They’re looking deep into your business plan, your company mission, your background, your way of dealing with people, and many other aspects of working practices.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3><strong>Twitter Poll</strong></h3>
<h3><img src="http://justcreativedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image-12.gif" alt="Twitter Poll" width="500" height="259" /></h3>
<p>I also <a href="http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1556321/">held a poll on Twitter</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/justcreative">follow me</a> ) about those who support spec work&#8230; at the time of writing over 84% agreed that &#8220;No, they didn&#8217;t support spec work&#8221; and a further 8% were unsure of their decision.</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1556321/">cast your vote</a> so we can get a more accurate representation. I wonder how many will change their views after reading this article?</p>
<h3>My Own Opinion</h3>
<p>If you hadn&#8217;t already guessed I am on the &#8220;spec work is evil&#8221; side of the fence although I am not 100% entirely against it - you could say that I am 99% against it&#8230; Spec work <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2009/03/15/spec-work-here-to-stay-but-not-for-everyone/">isn’t right for all designers</a> (especially due to economies of scale) and all situations and I don’t think anyone would argue that, but the market exists and there clearly is a demand for it - but that is not to say that doing spec work is &#8220;right&#8221; or ethical&#8230;</p>
<p>Design contest sites are not the future of graphic design&#8230; nor do I see a time when it ever will be, however, in the long term I believe spec work is going to be detrimental to the design industry&#8230; both devaluing design and designers as a whole (while making the world an uglier place). And with that said, it&#8217;s sad to say that spec work is <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2008/12/13/designers-why-spec-work-is-not-going-away-how-you-should-respond/">definitely here to stay</a>. In fact, design contest sites are now now implementing &#8220;corporate services&#8221; for large studios which obviously are going to be a direct threat to large existing agencies.</p>
<p>Thus, my opinion is to <strong>not support spec work</strong> and if you&#8217;re with me, I encourage you to send this article to whoever you see involving themselves in spec work so they can make an educated decision too.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I would like to summarise by quoting two views on how to look at spec work one by very &#8220;anti-spec&#8221; <a href="http://andrewhyde.net/">Andrew Hyde</a> and the other by <a href="http://www.callmejeffrey.com/">Jeffrey Kalmikoff</a> who holds a <a href="http://www.callmejeffrey.com/2009/02/27/its-ok-to-be-grey/">neutral view</a> to the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Hyde:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Oh, we have years to watch spec work blow up. There of those of use who care about design, and are speaking up and warning off the practice. I see a house of cards being built up, a developer cashing out on it and nobody warning them of the upcoming wind storm.The warnings are now, whether the community comes to respect the ecosystem, respect their neighbors and friends (I’m not talking about just design here) is yet to be known. Part of me wants to continue writing about this, part of me wants to say ‘I did my part’ and get some popcorn.</p>
<p>So what now? See someone using spec (with the community sites like <a href="http://99designs.com">99 designs</a> or <a href="http://crowdspring.com">CrowdSpring</a>)? Forward them this post. Or write your own. We all deserve better.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Kalmikoff:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The best thing to do for both sides is to get fully educated. Spend some time researching it. Spend some time talking to people on both sides. Read about the extreme examples. Read about the ones that may-or-may-not be spec depending on how you look at it. Get informed and make up your own mind about it. Sure it’s easier to only discuss this topic with people who have the same point of view as you have, but it’s also somewhat useless. Like anything - if you really care about it, take the time to see all the angles. Besides, how’s that old saying go? Keep your friends close…&#8221;</p></blockquote>
