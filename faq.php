					  <div data-content>
						  <p>Due dates are established when you make your initial reservation. They can be found under the FAQ tab on each event page, but they reference new sign ups only. Payment due dates are also included in your welcome packet and confirmed with every payment made on your account. Payment due dates do not change unless an extension is requested (fees apply). Please make payments when due to ensure you don’t incur fees or your reservation being cancelled.</p>
					  </div>

					</div><!-- end of accordion-->
					
					
					<div class="accordion" data-accordion>

					  <div data-control>Can I make payments before my due date?</div>
					  <div data-content>
						  <p>Yes and we actually encourage you to do so. Our payment plan was established to allow you the freedom to make payments at your convenience. Please make sure you are familiar and make all payments by the payment due dates established at registration.</p>
					  </div>

					</div><!-- end of accordion-->
					
					
					<div class="accordion" data-accordion>

					  <div data-control>What is the Registration Fee and what is it for?</div>
					  <div data-content>
						<p>The Registration Fee is a mandatory nonrefundable/nontransferable fee charged to hold/reserve an event package, current package price, and availability until your first payment is due.</p>
							<p>This fee is in addition to your overall package price. Every person within a group must pay the Registration Fee. It is not mandatory that all registration payments are paid at once. Everyone in the group must pay their Registration fee within 7 days of the initial payment.</p> 
							<p>Any payment made after 7 days of the initial Registration Fee will be booked and receive pricing/amenities at current market value.</p>
					  </div>

					</div><!-- end of accordion-->
					
					
					<div class="accordion" data-accordion>

					  <div data-control>Must the entire group pay the Registration Fee?</div>
					  <div data-content>
						<p>Yes. All prices are per person. The Registration Fee secures your spot for the event and is independent from the package price.</p>
					  </div>

					</div><!-- end of accordion-->
					
					
					
					<div class="accordion" data-accordion>

					  <div data-control>Why is the Registration non-refundable?</div>
					  <div data-content>
						  	<p>We are providing you with a service. This means:</p>
						  	<ul>
								<li>We take packages out of inventory, in good faith, on a lay-a-way basis.</li>
								<li>We provide a system for single/multiple payments that allows everyone in your party to use their own credit/debit cards.</li>
								<li>We provide package details clearly and concisely, so that everyone will know what is required, without ambiguity.</li>
						    </ul>

					  <div data-control>Does the price take care of hotel reservation for all 4 members in either package or only one person?</div>
					  <div data-content>
						<p>All prices listed are per person. Under the package prices description, all amenities included in your package are per person and includes one (1) room per group.</p>
					  </div>

					</div><!-- end of accordion-->
					
					
					<div class="accordion" data-accordion>

					  <div data-control>Your prices listed are only for up to four people max? Can you accommodate groups larger than four?</div>
					  <div data-content>
						<p>Yes, we can accommodate any size group, but due to hotel regulations the max occupancy per room is four. This is why you see pricing for up to four people.</p>
					  </div>

					</div><!-- end of accordion-->
					
					
					<div class="accordion" data-accordion>

					  <div data-control>Are there any other mandatory fees associated with my package? </div>

						<p>Yes, but only for another full-service package. For example, you may upgrade from the Emerald to a Diamond package or vice versa.<p>
						<p>However, you cannot change from the Diamond/Emerald package to a party pass only package because it is not a full-service package.</p>

					  <div data-control>Do you provide refunds?</div>
					  <div data-content>

					   </div>

					</div><!-- end of accordion-->
					
					<div class="accordion" data-accordion>

					  <div data-control>Should I purchase travelers insurance? </div>
